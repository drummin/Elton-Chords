Music by Elton John
Lyrics by Bernie Taupin

Intro: (delay the D bass note and invert chord down on second phrase)
(Am/G-G-Am-G/D   Am/G-G-Am-G/D    D  G-D)    2x


G                        C       G       D
I'm no longer counting, I'm not keeping score

        A/C#              Bm7          G       A
I could say my list of lovers doesn't matter anymore

                    Bm       
But some are always in my heart

     C               G/B
And some I'm not so sure

       A             D
Either way they all left their mark

        G              A   D-A
And for some I found a cure


chorus:

         Bm             A
And from one you learn something
      G                D
And another you learn, nothing
            Bm            G            D     G-D
And there's one who might teach you everything
     Bm                 A
But before I learned to listen
        G             D
And if indeed someone said it
         G                A              D   G-D        
Then I guess I must have lost it on the wind


(Am/G G Am G/D   Am/G G Am G/D      D  G-D)   2x



G                        C       G       D
Back when I was younger each one was a prize

A/C#            Bm7               G                A
Love just came along and hit you right between the eyes

                    Bm       
And one was just a trophy catch

     C             G/B
And one was like a curse

       A             D
Some would want to bleed you dry

        G              A
Some might quench your thirst


[repeat chorus] 2x with instr. break between

        Bm             A              G              D
In cold water I went fishing in warm seas I cast a line

               Bm                 G                      D     G-D
And swore the heart I was reeling in was perfect at the time

            Bm                 A               G             D
You couldn't tell me I was wrong, you couldn't tell me anything

                      G                  A              D   G-D 
And if you did then I guess I must have lost it on the wind
