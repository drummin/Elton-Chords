Bm                              C
Some punk with a shotgun killed - young Danny Bailey -
Bm                                C
In cold blood, in the lobby of a downtown motel.
Bm                        C
Killed him in anger.   A force he couldn't handle -
Em7                          Fmaj7
helped pull the trigger that cut short his life.
             Am                       Bbmaj7
And there's  -  not many knew him the way that we did.
     Am                                       Bbmaj7
Sure enough he was a wild one, but then aren't most hungry kids?  
     Am    /  G  /  F  /  Em  /
Oh - ohhh...


CHORUS:
D            F    G      Bm      Em           G  A      D
Now it's all over Danny Bailey   -   and the harvest is in.
C            G/B   Gm/Bb     D/A  C/G              G         D
Dillinger's dead.  Oh - oh - oh       I guess the cops won again.
             F    G      Bm      Em           G  A      D
Now it's all over Danny Bailey   -   and the harvest is in.



      Bm                      C
We're running short of heroes - back up here in the hills.
Bm                                       C
Without Danny Bailey we're gonna have to - break up our stills.
Bm                     C
So mark his grave well - `cause Kentucky loved him.
Em7                               Fmaj7
Born and raised a proper, I guess   -   life just bugged him.
       Am                         Bbmaj7
And he - found faith in danger, a lifestyle he lived by.
  Am                         Bbmaj7
A running gun youngster in a sad restless age.
     Am    /  G  /  F  /  Em  /
Oh - ohhh...
 

{Repeat Chorus}
