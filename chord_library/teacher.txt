Teacher I Need You
Elton John/Bernie Taupin

intro:
F  Gm7  Bb  F

      F          Gm       F
I was sitting in the classroom
Bb
Trying to look intelligent
   F                          C  F C F C F C 
In case the teacher looked at me
        Am                       Dm
She was long and she was lean
           Bb  F    Gm
She's a middle-aged dream
         F              Bb    F           Gm  C
And that lady means the whole world to me


It's a natural achievement
Conquering my homework
With her image pounding in my brain
She's an inspiration
For my graduation
                          Bb   C    F    Bb
And she helps to keep the classroom sane

(tacet)    Dm C    Bb  Dm            C 
Oh teacher I  need you like a little child
Am                Dm              Bb          C
You got something in you to drive a schoolboy wild
C           Dm C Bb          Dm       C
You give me education in the lovesick blues
Am                   Dm 
Help me get straight come out and say
Bb6                                             F   Eb  F  Eb
Teacher I, teacher I, teacher I, Teacher I need you


I have to write a letter
Tell about my feelings
Just to let her know the scene
Focus my attention
On some further education
In connection with the birdies and the bees


So I'm sitting in the classroom
I'm looking like a zombie
I'm waiting for the bell to ring
I've got John Wayne stances
I've got Erroll Flynn advances
And it doesn't mean a doggone thing

outro:
F  Gm7  Bb  F
Eb            F
Oh------------Oh------------
