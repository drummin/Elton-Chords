(INTRO)
Bb  Gm  F  Eb  Bb/D  F  Bb (repeat)


(VERSE ONE)
Bb                Gm            F
You and I live in modern times
          Eb                  Bb/D    Bb
And every day we face another hill to climb
Bb           Bm          Cm           Eb
It's easy to ignore this pain we read about
                   Bb/D               F      Bb
This sickness only happens in someone else's house

(VERSE TWO)
You don't need to hear another voice
You don't want this presssure, love should be your choice
But if it's love hang on 'til you're sure
Don't jump into the fire before you know the score
Eb                         Bb       F        Bb
Don't jump into the fire before you know the score


(CHORUS)
Bb        Bb            F       Bb
Hey love, love is worth waiting for
Bb       Bb            F       Bb
Oh love, love is worth waiting for
Bm
Take time to know them
Cm
Take time to be sure
Eb           Bb            F       Bb
'Cause love, love is worth waiting for

(INTERLUDE)
Bb  Gm  F  Eb  Bb/D  F  Bb (repeat)


(VERSE THREE)
It's so hard playing by the rules
The night is what you make it, but the payoff can be cruel
We believe we're safe from the hands of fate
But reckless love  these days can be your last mistake
    Eb                           Bb      F    Bb
But reckless love these days can be your last mistake

TO CHORUS:


(BRIDGE)
Bm                     Cm
Don't chace it if it's easy
Eb                    Fm
Don't push it if they might
Gm                      Am
That risk you'd like to take
                       Bb
Could be the risk that takes your life

TO CHORUS:


(OUTRO)
Bb  Gm  F  Eb  Bb/D  F  Bb (repeat)
