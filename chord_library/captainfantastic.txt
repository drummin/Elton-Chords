Am7            Bm C                      C        G    D
Captain Fantastic raised and regimented, hardly a hero
     G           C            D
Just someone his mother might know
Am7            G       Dm7               G7
Very clearly a case for corn flakes and classics
C                               Cm
"Two teas both with sugar please"
G      Eb7        Em
In the back of an alley


Am7                      C
While little Dirt Cowboys turned brown in their saddles
   G            D            G        C/E       D/F#
Sweet chocolate biscuits and red rosy apples in summer
         Am                G   Dm7                G7
For it's hay make and "Hey mom, do the papers say anything good?
C                            Cm
Are there chances in life for little Dirt Cowboys?
G                           Bb     C       G
Should I make my way out of my home in the woods?"


Am7           G/B  C
Brown Dirt Cowboy, still green and growing
           G       D7
City slick Captain
   G/D
Fantastic the feedback
C/E                         D
The honey the hive could be holding
            Am7         G/B           Dm7                   G7 Dm7 G7
For there's weak winged young sparrows that starve in the winter
C                           Cm
Broken young children on the wheels of the winners
G                                   Bb        C     G
And the sixty-eight summer festival wallflowers are thinning



Em                                                 C  F  C  F  C  F  C

For cheap easy meals are hardly a home on the range
Em                                                   C  F  C  F  C  F  
C  F
Too hot for the band with a desperate desire for change
G                    C             G
We've thrown in the towel too many times
             C                    G
Out for the count and when we're down
           C      G                   C
Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy
G       Bb            C             G
From the end of the world to your town

Am7                   G/B C
And all this talk of Jesus coming back to see us
      G                   D7
Mmmmmhmmmm, Couldn't fool us
G/D                          C/E                    D
For we were spinning out our lines walking on the wire
Am7               G/B             D7
Hand in hand went music and the rhyme
     G7  D7  G7  D7  Cm
The Captain and the Kid stepping in the ring
G                        Bb            C                  G
From here on sonny sonny sonny, it's a long and lonely climb
