I got home today

G
Took a look around

Trying to find that girl of mine

She could not be found

All her things were gone

She just left a note

It don't take no mastermind

   G		     D
To figure what she wrote

And she said dear John I'm mov-ing on

By this time I'm gonna be long gone

We could not go on

Living like we were

A Dear John note to her
