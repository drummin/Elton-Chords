Has anybody here seen Razor Face
  Am              Dm                      E7      Ebo
I heard he's back looking for a place to lay down
Dm                 Em7
  Must be getting on
F                   Am        C7/G     F
  Needs a man who's young to walk him round
C/E                  F                 Am7
  Needs a man who's young to walk him round

      C6/E                 F
Oh it must be hard for the likes of you
Am             Dm                         Em
To get by in a world that you just can't see through
Ebo                Em7
  And it looks so cold
F              Am              Cm7/G  C9/G  F
  How does it feel to know you can't   go   home
C/E            F                        Am7
  How does it feel to know you can't go home

     G          G7/F              C/E    F
       Come on Razor Face my old friend
     G               G7/F                   C/E    F
       I'll meet you down by the truck stop inn
            Am                     C7/G
     With a bottle of booze in the back of my car
              F                      F#o
     You're a song on the lips of an aging star

     C/E             F
     Razor Face, oh amazing grace
        C/E                F
     Protects you like a glove
              Am               Dm
     And I'll never learn the reason why
       Bb         F
     I love your Razor Face
