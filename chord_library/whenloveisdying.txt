verse

Bb                                           F+/A

They say we bruise too easily. I don't know if it's that way for me

Fm/Ab                                                                   G7

I've seen 'em come, I've seen 'em go I've seen everyone I know

                           Cm                                 F F7

Fall in and out of love. It's just the way it goes

2nd verse

Word is out, silence seems so loud. There's no light above or below me now

I've seen it grow, I've seen it live. I've seen everything I give

Falling out my hands, no matter who I'm with

And nobody ever tells you, when love is dying, when love is dying

          Bb7

It just gets a little colder

Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh-Oh when love is dying

3rd verse

There's a pain you never can explain Cuts so deep time and time again

I felt it then, I feel it now But nobody told me how

To fight a world of hurt Somebody help me now

                                                                                                             Bb
