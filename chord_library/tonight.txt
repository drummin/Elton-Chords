Tonight

Cm		     Bb
Do we have to fight again

  Ab
Tonight

Ab     Ab      Ab\G  F
I just want to go to sleep

Bb   Cm  Bb\D Eb
Turn out the  light

Eb      Eb\F    Eb\G  Ab
But you want to carry grudges

Ab	   Ab\G   F
Nine times out of ten

		  Bb
I see the storm approaching

Bb			    Ab      Cm\G G
Long before the rain starts falling


  Cm
Tonight

Cm		       Bb
Does it have to be the old thing

  Ab
Tonight

Ab       Ab Ab\G    F
It's late,  too late

F	     Cm	     Bb\D        Eb 
To chase the rainbow that you're after

    Eb	    Eb\F   Eb\G  Ab
I'd like to find a compromise

    Ab	     Ab\G    F
And place it in your hands

F				 Bb
My eyes are blind, my ears can't hear

Bb		      Ab   Cm\G G
And I cannot find the time


  Cm    G\C  Cm
Tonight

     Cm			       Dm
Just let the curtains close in silence

  Gm7
Tonight

			     Cm    Cm\Bb F\A
Why not approach with less defiance

    F\A			      G\B
The man who'd love to see you smile

Who'd love to see you smile
