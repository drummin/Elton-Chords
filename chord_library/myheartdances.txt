Music by Elton John
Lyrics by Tim Rice

Dm   Bb   Csus4   C
Dm   Bb   Csus4   C

		  Gm7	F	      C/E         F
I see you in the distance and I see us as we are
    C/E		Gm7		F	       C/E  F  C/E  F
So nearly so contented but a careless word too far
   C/E          Dm  Dm/C              Bb	
I see you in confusion for a once enchanted boy
	  Gm7	  A7		     Dm   Bb   Csus4   C
My heart dances, oh oh, but not for joy

Dm   Bb   Csus4   C

I longed to love you better but I swear I don't know how
You could have been my future but I had to have it now
The things we love completely we are fated to destroy
My heart dances, oh oh, but not for joy

Dm   Bb   Csus4   C
Dm   Bb   Csus4   C

      Bb		      F/A
It's easy to be certain that another's heart will fall
      Gm7	   F	  C/E  Dm  C/E
Much harder to be certain of your own
    Bb					F/A
It moves you, and inspires you then it drives you to the wall
     Gm7	   F  C/E       C
And leaves you so excited but alone

	  Gm7	  A7
My heart dances, oh oh
	  Gm7	  A7
My heart dances, oh oh
	  Gm7	  A7		     Dm   Bb   Csus4   C
My heart dances, oh oh, but not for joy
	    Dm   Bb   Csus4   C
But not for joy
	    Dm   Bb   Csus4   C
But not for joy
	    Dm   Bb   Csus4   C
But not for joy
