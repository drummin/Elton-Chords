I never dreamed I could cry so hard

That ain't like a man
Eb                 F    Bb C  D
I could fly like a bird some days
      Eb                  F

I never knew it could hurt so   bad

All I ever wanted was a reason

To drown in your eyes
Bb                    F
I never knew sleep so restless
Gm7           F
Empty arms so cold
