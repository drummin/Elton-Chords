C G  D  Em  Dm4  C F\C C  C\D  D7

G	       D
You win again, you gypsy heart

Em	        Dm4 C
I count the days    that we're apart

D	      E
I sleep alone when you're away

Am  	    C\G    C\D          D7   C\D
No sense in saying I wish you'd stay

G		   D
It's all the same, you never change

Em	       Dm4 C
You come and go    just like the rain

D 		E	     E\G#
I pray each day that you are gone

E7\B	 Am D7		   G    G  Am  F\C 
This time   it won't be so long


Bb			    F\A
Your gypsy heart will never find

    F       D\F#    Gm
Any arms as warm as mine

	  Gm      Bb\F      Eb  Bb\D
And gypsy when we meet again

 	     Cm
I'll play my part

	     Bb\D	  Ab\Eb
And wrap you up inside my arms 

F
Oh you gypsy heart

Bb			    F\A
Your gypsy heart can always call

  	  F	  D\F#	     Gm
When your back's against the wall

	    Gm	      Bb\F    Eb   Bb\D
And darling then I'll just pretend

	       Cm 
Right from the start

	  Bb\D		Ab\Eb F 	   G     
You never left me on my own   oh you gypsy heart

G  C\G G  D  Em  Dm4  C  D\C  D7


D 		E	     E\G#
I pray each day that you are gone

E7\B	 Am D7		   G    G  Am  F\C 
This time   it won't be so long
