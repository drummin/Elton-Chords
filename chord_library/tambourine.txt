First cat back here gets the cream

And bounce a little rhythm On my tambourine

Smack in the middle

Toss it in the air

When I'm out of steam

You got my head ringing like a tambourine

A curveball coming That I didn't see

  F                          G/D      D
A flash flood washing Out a dried up creek

  G        D           Em       Bm
I went in muddy But I came out clean

        Em       A          Em/B  A  G
Like a Baptist banging On a tambourine


CHORUS

     C                  Am            G
You're a spinning-round gypsy in the moonlight

Am         G             D
Cymbals flashing in the firelight

C                Am       G
I'm free=falling into a dream

    F
My hidden heart banging

          Dsus  D
Like the tambourine

CHORUS
