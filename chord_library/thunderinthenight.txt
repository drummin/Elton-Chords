Gm\Bb		   F
Ain't no loving tonight

   C			   Gm
My woman says she ain't my woman

Gm\Bb		 F
I sure put up a fight

           C
To keep it right


	 Gm\Bb		       F
I used a whole lot of pride to get her

	 C			Gm
I used a whole pack of lies and begged her

Gm		       F
She just threw me the key

	       Dm7  E
and said she's free


Am
Thunder in the night

Am
Thunder in the night again

Dm		       F  G
Thunder in the night again

Am
Thunder in the night

Am
Thunder in the night again

Dm		       F   G
Thunder in the night again


Am		       G
Frightening lightning hit me again

     Dm7		       Am
It's burning much deeper this time

	   Am			      G
I got them storm clouds hanging right over my head

	  F			 E E E\G# E\B E
And it's gonna rain harder this ti____________me

Gm\Bb			  F
Out here searching the streets

  C			   Gm
I gotta find my woman and tell her

Gm\Bb		  F
I never wanted to cheat

		C
But she cheated me


	Gm\Bb		      F
I never knew just how much I loved her

        C		      Gm
I never knew till I went and lost her

Gm\Bb		  F
Now it's all too late

	   Dm7  E
She's gone away
