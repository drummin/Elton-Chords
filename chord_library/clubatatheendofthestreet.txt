The club at the end of the street
Sleeping with the past - 1989
Elton John and Bernie Taupin

(Intro) Ab/Eb   Eb  (x4) 

   Eb              G
When the shades are drawn
     Ab           Eb
And the light of the moon is banned
        Bb
And the stars up above
        Ab/Bb
Walk the heavens hand in hand.
   Eb        G
There's a shady place
      Ab        Ab/A
At the end of the working day
        Eb/Bb
Where young lovers go
  Bb7  Ab/Eb   Eb  Ab/Eb    Eb
And this hot little trio plays.

   Ab   Db/Ab    Ab
That's where we meet
    Eb   Db/Ab   Eb
That's where we meet
    G    Ab    Fm
Me and you rendezvous
 Bbaug      Eb   Ab/Eb    Ab   
In the club at the end of the street.
Oooh where we meet
Oooh where we meet
Me and you rendezvous
In the club at the end of the street.

(Intro) again

(Same as Verse 1)
From the alleyways
Where the catwalks gently sway
You hear the sound of Otis
And the voice of Marvin Gaye.
In this smoky room
There's a jukebox plays all night
And we can dance real close
Beneath the pulse of a neon light.

   Ab   Db/Ab    Ab
That's where we meet
    Eb   Db/Ab   Eb
That's where we meet
    G    Ab    Fm
Me and you rendezvous
 Bbaug      Eb   Ab/Eb    Ab   
In the club at the end of the street.
Oooh where we meet
Oooh where we meet
Me and you rendezvous
In the club at the end of the street.

(Intro) again

      Fm           Bb7
There's a downtown smell of cooking
           Eb         Ab
From the flame on an open grill
          Eb        Bb
There's a sax and a big bass pumping
  Gb      Ab
Lord have mercy.
   Ab     Eb
You can't sit still.
    Ab     Eb
You can't sit still.
