F     *    Am7             *     Dm         *       F6/C        *
Cool grass blowing up the pass - don't you know I'm feeling mellow?
Bdim   *        Dm    F6/C  Bb *             F          *   G7   *  *
Oh, I love your Roman nose,      the way you curl your toes baby.
              *      C7       /Bb  /A  /G
     Make me feel so mellow.
F         *                Am                    *
It's the same old feeling  -  I get when you're stealing -
     Dm     *     F6/C  *
     back into my bed again
Bdim *          Dm       F6/C   Bb  *         F       *
       With the curtains closed       and the window froze -
G7  *        *     *       C7  /  /  C9sus
      by the rhythm of the rain.


CHORUS:
Dm              Bb        Dm                G7       F7
Oh, you make me mellow.     Oh, you make me mellow.  Rocking smooth & slow.
Bdim                  A7         Bb                      F
Mellow's the feeling that we get watching the coal fire glow.
Dm              Bb        Dm               G7
Oh, you make me mellow.     Oh, I make you mellow.
F7                               Bdim                   A7
Wrecking the sheets real fine.   Heaven knows what you sent me Lord-
         Bb            F             Bb / F /     Bb / F /
     but God this is a mellow time.



F      *          Am7        *   Dm        *       F6/C       *
Going down to the stores in town - getting all the things we need.
Bdim   *           Dm      F6/C  Bb  *     F       *
      Oh, don't forget the beer    -    my little dear.  
G7  *              *      *       C7  /Bb  /A  /G
      It helps to sow the mellow seed.
F       *            Am          *            Dm          *          F6/C *
And it can't be bad,    all the love I've had    coursing through my life.
Bdim   *         Dm     F6/C   Bb  *           F          *
      Whoa, down in the pass         where the wind blows fast -
    G7      *          *       *    C7  /  /  C9sus
and mellow, mellow's a feeling right.
