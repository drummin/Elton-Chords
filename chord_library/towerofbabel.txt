Snow.   Ce  - ment      and ivory young towers.

G/F   /G-/A  Eb/Bb                              Bb
             But where were all your shoulders when we cried?
         Fm/Ab           G7                Cm
Were the darlings on the sideline dreaming up such cherished lies -
   F/A                          | Bb   Cm7  |  Bb/D  Cm7 - Bb  |  
to whisper in your ear before you die?

Eb         Eb7                      Ab       Bb
It's party time for the guys in the tower of Babel.

Sodom meet Gomorrah.          Cain meet   A   -  bel.

Have a ball y'all.  See the letches crawl with the call girls under the table.
                      Ab
Watch them dig their graves -
Eb/Bb                              Bb                  Cm
      'Cause Jesus don't save the guys in the tower of Babel.
Ab                          Eb/Bb
      Watch them dig their graves -
                             Bb                  Fm              Eb
'Cause Jesus don't save the guys in the tower of Babel.  No. No. No.

Junk.  An  - gel.        This closet's always stacked.

G/F   /G-/A | Eb/Bb                                   Bb
                   But where were all your shoulders when we cried?
         Fm/Ab        G7              Cm
Were the doctors in attendance saying how they felt so sick inside?
   F/A                              | Bb   Cm7  |  Bb/D  Cm7 - Bb  |  
Or was it just the scalpel blade that lied?
