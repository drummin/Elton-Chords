THERE'S STILL TIME FOR ME (John/Taupin)

 D                A
Turn towards the neon night
                G     D       A
And watch the spectre of the night time
 D                 A
Read the signpost killing time
          G        D               A
And they can't see me, they can't see

     G             A
Synthetic sounds around the town
         G          D    A
Moaning bus queues all alone
  G                   A
Trying to find their own way home
           G        D         A   C7
Some are young and some are grown...

  F                    Am
There's still time for me
      Bb                      C
With just a little help from you
 Bb            F       Dm
There's still time for me
 Bb6                   A7
There's still time for me

 D               A
The mist of the city
     G              D         A
Has soaked right through my clothes
     D                A
The people who were there before
     G      D        A
Were only there to gloat

     G             A
Synthetic sounds around the town
         G          D    A
Moaning bus queues all alone
  G                   A
Trying to find their own way home
           G        D         A   C7
Some are young and some are grown...

  F                    Am
There's still time for me
      Bb                      C
With just a little help from you
 Bb            F       Dm
There's still time for me
 Bb6                   A7
There's still time for me

  F                    Am
There's still time for me
      Bb                      C

 Bb            F       Dm
There's still time for me
 Bb6                   A7
There's still time for me

  F                    Am
There's still time for me
      Bb                      C
With just a little help from you
 Bb            F       Dm
There's still time for me
 Bb6                   A7
There's still time for me

There's still time for me...(repeat & fade)
