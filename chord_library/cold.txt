Dm - C            F            C      Dm/C-C  F/C
        You don't love him any more.
C             F                C   Dm/C-C
He threw your rag doll out the door.
          Db                   Ab     Db/Ab-Ab
I kept my distance.  I held my breath.  
            Eb                   F7     /C   /F
Love always ends up hanging by a thread.


BRIDGE:
     /A       Bbm                  Db/Ab
Love hurts so much.  Love leaves a scar.  
              Gb                         F7
"I don't love you" is like a stake being driven through your heart.



CHORUS:     Gb             Db
But I don't care.   I came back for you.
        Gb                 Db/Ab     F+5/A  Bbm          Gb/Db F7    Bbm
Love is cruel, but I don't care.   I wanted you, and I'm cold, cold, cold.


C        F            C      Dm/C-C  F/C
You said don't cry to me.
C              F               C       Dm/C-C
He said "I'm a dead man if you leave."
          Db                   Ab     Db/Ab-Ab
I have no feelings.  I have no heart.
            Eb                           F7     /C   /F
Love always cuts out the warm and tender part.
     /A       Bbm                  Db/Ab
Love hurts so much.   Love cuts so deep.
       Gb                                F7
It's a hot sweat and a cold shake - like drowning in your sleep.

    Bbm /// //// Gb/Db/// F7/// Bbm/// ////   Gb/Db    F7           Gb/Db  F7
I'm cold.                           Honey I'm cold. So cold. I'm so cold.  Cold.
