The Diving Board

         Eb                      Ebdim7
Took a high dive arcing out wide
              Bb   Dm/A   G
Into the crowd
    Ab(b5)/D    Eb                     Ebm
Out to the sound of their wild applause
                          Bb   Dm/A  G
But you've heard it before
                       Cm
And you've seen it all
     Db                 Ab        Gm
From up there on the diving board
       Eb                 Ebdim7 
You'd free fall into the ether
             Bb    Eb/G  Bb
Above the people
    Ab(b5)/D        Eb                  Ebm
Out   on      a limb fragile and adored
                         Bb   Dm/A   G
But who below knows that
                       Cm
You're still a mystery
Db               Ab
Way up on the diving board

chorus:
             Cm            D
Sink or swim,    I can't recall
     Gm                         Em7(b5)
Who said that to me? When I was sixteen
    Ab6                             Gm   G
And full of the world and its noise
                 Cm
But you beat the drum
                         D
You fell in love with it all
             Gm                 G
The planets alight, those dizzy heights
        Db/Eb         Ab            Gm
And the view from the diving board


         Eb                           Ebdim7
Took the grand prize you and your eyes
               Bb   Eb/G  Bb
Butterfly light
   Ab(b5)/D       Eb
Escaping      the reach
                         Ebm
Of their fangs and their claws
                         Bb   Dm/A   G
Such a pale little thing
                   Cm
In your lily-white skin
Db               Ab         Gm
High up on the diving board
