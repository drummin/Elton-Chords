Am                          C      Am                             C
And when we start we say forever.  We say: "We care. We need. We feel."
Bb                          Dm    Gm7                           C
We read the movement of our eyes, but in our hearts we still believe.
Am                           C       Am                         C
The end will come, before we know.   The silent rule of love applies.
Bb                           Dm         Gm7                           C
We light the fuse and let it burn out.  We just accept that love must die.



CHORUS:
    /D-/C   F        Eb       C
And so they say, the end will come for us.
    /D-/C   F           Ab             BbaddC
And so the world, slows down to let us off.
             F             Gm7    F/A          Bb
Just hang it up and let it go.  Accept it if I must.
              F/C              Bb/D           Eb/G              Bb/F
But I don't believe, I don't believe that the end will come for us.
               F        Eb  Bb/D  Ab  C7  F
No, I don't believe the end will come for us.



Am                            C      Am                       C
The end will come like sudden rain.  The end is never what it seems.
Bb                         Dm     Gm7                         C
We sink the ship before we sail.  We just accept what failure means.
