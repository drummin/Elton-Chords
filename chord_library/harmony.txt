Dm                   C
Hello.  Baby, Hello.   Haven't seen your face for a while.
Gm                  Dm/F             Dm                              A7
Have you quit doing time for me?  Or are you still the same spoiled 
child?
Dm                    C
Hello.  I said Hello.   Is this the only place you thought to go?
Gm                    Dm/F
Am I the only man you ever had? 
        Dm                    A7                | D   /    G  /  |  A  
|   
     Or am I just the last surviving friend that you know?



CHORUS:
Em          A7         D          /C#  Bm
Harmony and me, we're pretty good company.
Em             A7            D
Looking for an island in our boat upon the sea.
Em       A7                           D      /C#         Bm
Harmony, gee I really love you and I want to love you forever.
   Em                 A7                    D
I dream of the never, never, never leaving Harmony.




Dm                   C
Hello.  Baby, Hello.   Open up your heart and let your feelings flow.
Gm                 Dm/F        Dm                     A7
You're not unlucky knowing me keeping the speed real slow.
   Dm/F               C                        A7               | D / G 
/ | A |
In any case I set my own pace by stealing the show. Say Hello. Hello.
 


{Repeat Chorus}

Coda: ...never leaving Harmony.           Harmony.          Harmony.

      Harmony.          Harmony.          Harmony.          Harmony.
      G    /G  /D  G/A |  D  |
      Harmony.     Ahh - ahh!
