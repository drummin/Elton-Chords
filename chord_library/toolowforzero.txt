Dm		  Dm C\D
Six o'clock alarm

Bb
I get the wake up call

C
Let that sucker jingle-jangle

Dm
Ring right off the wall

Dm		     Dm C\D
I'm too low for zero

Bb
I'm too tired to work

C
Tied one on with a friend last night

	      Dm
And wound up losing my shirt


F		C
I'm too low for zero

C
I'm on a losing streak

Dm		  C
I got myself in a bad patch lately

  Bb
I can't seem to get much sleep

F	        C
I'm too low for zero

C
I wind up counting sheep

Dm		 C
Nothing seems to make much sense

     Bb
It's all just Greek to me


	     F   C    C   Bb   Bb  F\A     C    
You know I'm too low, too low, too low for zero

	     F	 C    C   Bb   Bb  C       C
You know I'm too low, too low, too low for zero


Dm			   Dm C\D
Cutting out cups of coffee

Bb
Switching off the late night news

C
Putting the cat out two hours early

   Dm
It isn't any use

Dm		     Dm C\D
I'm too low for zero

Bb
Insomnia attacks

C
Watching flies with my eyes till sunrise

Dm
It's daylight when I hit the sack
