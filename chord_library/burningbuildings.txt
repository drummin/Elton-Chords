INTRO: F / / /     Ebm / / /     F / / /     Eb / / /     Db / / /     Eb / / /



F                        Eb       D7                        Gm
It used to be a sweet sensation   -  no price too high for love.
      Eb  /G       Bb                             Eb/Db
Now I pay for this bitter taste, and the price is  not enough.
Ab/Eb                                Fm/D
Such cruel sport for your kicks.     Such hard knocks on my heart.
Dbmaj7                             Db/Eb
How long before the pain ends?     Tell me where living starts.



CHORUS:
Eb - Ab                               Cm/G
And lovers leap off burning buildings   -   waking up on a sky high wire.
Fm/D                            Db                    /Db-/Eb-/F-/G  /Ab-/Bb
Desperation leaves us clinging   -   on the edge of a house on fire.
Ab                                 Cm/G
Lovers leap off burning buildings.      Live our life on borrowed time.
Fm/D                             Db                       /Db-/Eb-/F-/G  /Ab-/Bb 
Every flame that ever moved you  -  touched your lips but never mine.
Ab              Ebm     Gb   (C-Db trill in melody)
Lovers leap off burning buildings.



F                 Eb       D7                        Gm
No room for conversation.      Cold stares and angry words.
        Eb     /G       Bb                   Eb/Db
Fall in pieces from our faces.   We read "do  not  disturb".
Ab/Eb                         Fm/D
Some lovers just go hungry.   Others beg for just a bite.
Dbmaj7                          Db/Eb
You use me under pressure   -   to whet your appetite.


INSTR: D / C /     Bm / / /     A / G /     F / / /
       D / C /     Bm / / /     A / G /     F / / /     Eb / / /


{Repeat Chorus}
