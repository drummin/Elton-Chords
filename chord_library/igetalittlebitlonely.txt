(Instrumental)...............

E                  A
Never thought I'd miss you
 E                 D  B7
When you said goodbye...
E                  A
Never thought I'd see the day
     E                 D   B
That I break down and cry...
G#7               C#m
Won't you come on back to me
F#m               A
Back where you belong, 'cause I

E                   A
I get a little bit lonely baby
F#m        G#m   A      B7
Lonely and blue missing you
E                   A
I get a little bit lonely baby
   F#m      G#m         A        B7
If you ever come back, gonna be true

E                A
Though I know I hurt you
 E               D   B7
Couldn't you forgive...
E              A
For I know without you
        E           D    B
It's impossible to live...
G#7                   C#m
I want you back in my arms again
F#m               A
Back where you belong, 'cause I

E                   A
I get a little bit lonely baby
F#m        G#m   A      B7
Lonely and blue missing you
E                   A
I get a little bit lonely baby
   F#m      G#m         A        B7
If you ever come back, gonna be true

Eb       Gm            Ab          Bb
Come on baby, let's forgive and forget
    Fm           Gm
And even though things are bad
     Ab           Bb
I'm gonna get you yet

E        A
Do do do do do do do
F#m   G#m   A     B7
Do do do do do do do do
E        A
Do do do do do do do
F#m   G#m   A     B
Do do do do do do do do

Eb       Gm            Ab          Bb7
Come on baby, let's forgive and forget

And even though things are bad
     Ab           Bb
I'm gonna get you yet

E                   A
I get a little bit lonely baby
F#m        G#m   A      B7
Lonely and blue missing you
E                   A
I get a little bit lonely baby
F#m        G#m   A      B7
Lonely and blue missing you
