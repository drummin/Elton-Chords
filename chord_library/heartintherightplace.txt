                Gm
I've got a good by-line, they all know my name.
                  F                        C
The queen of the sly line, I feed on your fame.
              Dm           C     Bb                     Gm
But I got my heart in the right place, it's all in the game.
                 Gm     
If you're doing fine boy, you got my vote.
                 F                            C
But step out of line boy and I'll go for your throat.
                 Dm           C     Bb                  Gm
`Cause I got my heart in the right place, so give me a quote.


D                  Eb        F                      Gm
I'll ask you some questions,    I'll tell you some lies.
Cm               Dsus    D           Gm
You'll open your heart   -   like a friend.
D                 Ab        F                  Gm
I'll make up some answers   -   you won't recognize.
Cm                       Dsus D         Dm             C     Bb           
Gm
The you I create with my pen.   But my heart's in the right place, now 
& again.


    Dm             C     Bb                   Gm
My heart's in the right place.   Know what I mean?
My heart's in the right place,   on page seventeen.



I'll ask you some questions,    I'll tell you some lies.
You don't understand,     but you will.
I'll make up some answers   -   cut you down to size.
Then I move in for the kill.
        Dm             C     Bb          Dm             C     Bb
But my heart's in the right place.   My heart's in the right place.
    Dm             C     Bb                       Gm
My heart's in the right place - it's part of the skill.


 Dm             C     Bb                    Dm            C    Bb
Heart's in the right place.    I'm gonna destroy you              and 
your repu-
tation   -               don't count for nothing         with  me.
`Cause I'm an  old   bitch you see.      My heart in the right place.
            Gm       Dm              C     Bb                Gm
Don't you agree?     Heart's in the right place, just wait & see.
                     Heart's in the right place, don't you agree?
