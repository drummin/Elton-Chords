For our world, the circle turns again.
                                           G
Throughout the year we've seen the seasons change.
                    Gmaj7          C/G
It's meant a lot to  me  to start anew.
                                          G
Oh the winter's cold but I'm so warm with you.



                  F     C/E         G
Out there there's not a sound to be heard -
        F               C/E              D7sus
And the seasons seem to sleep upon their words.
       G                Gmaj7              C/G
As the waters freeze up with  the summer's end -
         Am/G                            G
oh, it's funny how young lovers start as friends.
         Am/G            C/G             G       G  D\G G
Yes it's funny how young lovers start as friends
