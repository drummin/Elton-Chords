Hello.  Baby, Hello.   Haven't seen your face for a while.

Have you quit doing time for me?  Or are you still the same spoiled child?
Cb/Eb                  Db6
Hello.  I said Hello.   Is this the only place you thought to go?
Abm7                  Gb
Am I the only man you ever had? 
Ebm                    Bb7                      Eb    Ab  Bb   
Or am I just the last surviving friend that you know?

Fm          Bb7       Eb          /D   Cm
Harmony and me, we're pretty good company.
Fm             Bb7           Eb
Looking for an island in our boat upon the sea.
Fm       Bb7                         Eb       /D         Cm
Harmony, gee I really love you and I want to love you forever.

I dream of the never, never, never leaving Harmony.

Hello.  Baby, Hello.   Open up your heart and let your feelings flow.
Abm7               Gb         Ebm                    Bb7
You're not unlucky knowing me keeping the speed real slow.
