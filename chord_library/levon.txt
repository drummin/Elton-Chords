Levon wears his war wound like a crown
Bb                   F
He calls his child Jesus
C/E                        Dm
`Cause he likes the name
       Am               Bb               Gm7
And he sends him to the finest school in town
F      Bb/F            F
Levon, Levon likes his money
Bb                  F
He makes a lot they say
C/E            Dm
Spend his days counting
     Am            Bb        Gm7
In a garage by the motorway

Levon sells cartoon balloons in town
His family business thrives
Jesus blows up balloons all day
Sits on the porch swing watching them fly
And Jesus, he wants to go to Venus
Leaving Levon far behind
Take a balloon and go sailing
While Levon, Levon slowly dies

to chorus and play twice 2nd time 
to outro
