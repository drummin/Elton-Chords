Blues For Baby and Me
Elton John/Bernie Taupin

into: C   G  (repeat)

     D   C   G   C   D    C D    C      D    C  G
Your old man got mad when I told him we were leaving
   D      C      D    C D  C  D     C  D   C  G
He cursed and he raged and he swore at the ceiling
   F      C   F        C      F    C    F    C  F   Em   E
He called you his child, said honey get wise to his game
      F   C      F   C     F        C     F    C   F   C   Em
He'll get you in trouble I know it, those bums are all the same
          D   C     D  C    D  C   D     C       D    C   G
There's a greyhound outside in the lane, it's waiting for us
   D    C   D   C    Am7         D7sus4       D
So tell him goodbye, we gotta go west on that bus

C D7sus4...

         G
And it's all over now
          Bm
Don't you worry no more
C                    G  (sus4) G
Gonna go west to the sea
C   G
The greyhound is swaying
        Bm
And the radio is playing
     C                  D
Some blues for baby and me
            Bm                Em
And the highway looks like it never did
        Am                 G  C
Lord it looks so sweet and so free
      G                      Bm
And I can't forget that trip to the west
        C         D7       C
Singing blues for baby and me


Saw your hands trembling, your eyes opened in surprise
It's ninety in the shade babe, and there ain't a cloud in the sky
I called you my child, said honey now this is our game
There's two of us to play it and I'm happy to be home again
There's a greyhound outside in the lane, it's waiting for us
So tell him goodbye, we gotta go west on that bus
