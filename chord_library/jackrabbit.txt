G
Go Jack Rabbit running through the woods
                                C         G      Bbdim
You've had a good night and you feel real loose
A7
Heard they got you going 'round the goose-creek shed
          D7                                G
Trying to fill your belly full of buck-shot lead


G
Go Jack Rabbit get the cabage patch 
                           C
Farmer left the back porch door on the latch
A7
Heard you coming and he got his gun
           D7                              G
You better go Jack Rabbit, better start to run


D  Dm6  C                          G
Go Jack Rabbit running through the woods
      C          A7                D7
Had a good night and you feel real loose
G                        C        A7
Gun fire breaking up the peaceful night
G                        D7       G
Jack Rabbit lying in the cold day light

repeat whole song and end on G major chord
