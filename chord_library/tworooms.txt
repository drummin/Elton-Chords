   Dm7                              C/E
1) Through a mutual agreement,            we got that aching feeling - 
2) Well we've both ridden the wagon   -   bit the tail off the dragon.
3) Door to door they would whisper,      "Will they ever get together?

F                             G                Am(sus)-Am-Am   G-Am-Am   Em7
1)            to look up one another one more time.
2)     Borne our swords like steel knights on the highway.
3) Their rooms are different temperatures I'm told.

   Dm7                                C/E
1) Tracking down the zip codes,             sealing down those envelopes.
2) Washing down the dirt roads,             hosing off our dirty clothes.
3) There's a change in their thinking.      And their habits seem uneven.

    F                      G                         Am(sus)-Am-Am  G-Am-Am  Em7
1)          Lack of communication on the telephone      line.
2) Come to terms with the times that we couldn't but we tried.
3)       But together the two  of  them  were  mining   gold."

   Dm7                             C/E
1) But don't judge us by distance       or the difference between us.
2) Where there is one room,             you'll always find another.
3) Where there is one room,             you'll always find another.

      F                G                Am(sus)-Am-Am  G-Am-Am  Em7
  1)   Try to look at it  with an open mind.
  2) Two rooms at the end   of   the   world.
  3) Two rooms at the end   of   the   world.



CHORUS:                      C/E
For where there is one room,       you'll always find another.
F                 G         Dm/C - C - F/C       Dm/C - C - F/C
Two rooms at the end of the world.
