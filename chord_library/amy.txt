Em
Tread on my face if you like little lady.
A7
Turn me inside out if you have to baby.
C#m                              A7
But don't you cross me off your list.
C#m                          A7
Ooh, I am young and I ain't never been kissed.  
C7                 D                   E7
Never been kissed  -  by a lady called Amy



Em                                      A7
You're far out, you're fab and insane.  A woman of the world, it's quite plain.
C#m                  A7                    C#m                A7
My dad told me Amy's your name.  Said he'd break my neck if I played your game.
           C7                    D                    E7
But he can bust my neck `cause I - I love you all the same.


C7
Amy, I know you don't have to show your affection -
           Em
`Cause the big boys like you and to you I'm an infection.
Gm                        A7                             C7
So if you don't want me around I think I'll run along & drown
                           D - B7    Em
You can't want this bum in town,     Amy.



Em
I'm beaten on the streets `cause I loves you.
A7
I watch you go to work in the summer.
C#m                    A7
I don't whistle at you down the street.
C#m                             A7
I would if I could but I can't whistle, you see.
C7                      D                             C7
Amy, I may not be James Dean.   Amy, I may not be nineteen
                      D
And I may still be in romper boots & jeans.
    C7      D7                                Em
But ooh Amy - you're the girl that wrecks my dreams.
