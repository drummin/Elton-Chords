    A        F#m     E
The night we met, we stood

	     D		      C#m
Divided by defenses as old as time

    A        F#m     E
But love has found a way

   E		    D                 C#m
To bring me to your senses and you to mine


E     E\F#        E\G#     D\A A
So we meet in the cloak of evening

E      E\F#      E\G# D\A A
And we try to go on believing

G	      D\F#   Dm\F         A\E  F#
Two different worlds can still be one

Bm	    A\C#	D	    D                  A   D  C  G\B
You and me, you and me, you and me, we can conquer the sun


A            F#m     E
The night we met, we knew

     E                  D             C#m
What love would soon be leading us to do

    A     F#m       E
And so it goes, and now

     E		      D			 C#m
When wanting turns to needing, I turn to you


E        E\F#       E\G# A      
And it's hard to go on deceiving

E      E\F#       E\G# A
But we have to go on believing

     G           D\F# Dm       A\E  F#
That someday our love will overcome

Bm	    A\C#	D	    D                  A   D  C  G\B
You and me, you and me, you and me, we can conquer the sun

(INSTRUMENTAL VERSE)

E    E\F#         E\G#     A
As I lie here and feel you breathing

E	 E\F#	 E\G#    A
It's not hard to keep on believing

     G           D\F# Dm   A\E      F#
That someday our love will overcome

Bm	    A\C#	D	    D                  A   D  
You and me, you and me, you and me, we can conquer the sun

		      A  D
We can conquer the sun

		      C  G\B
We can conquer the sun
