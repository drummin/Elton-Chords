         Dm7/F                
Well she looked a peach in the dress she made
                  Em7/G
     when she was still her mama's little girl.
             Dm7/F                                         Em7/G
And when she walked down the aisle everybody smiled at her innocence and curls.
         Dm7                                      
And when the preacher said is there anyone here 
      Am                        Bb     /F-/Bb   /F-/Bb   /C-/Bb
got a reason why they shouldn't wed?
                           F                    C   F/D  C   G
I should have stuck up my hand.   I should have got up   to stand.
    C              F           Gsus      G
And this is what I should have said:




                        C  C/E  F  C/E  F  Fsus-F-G  G  G  C/G-G
I wanna kiss the bride yeah!
                        C  C/E  F  C/E  F  Fsus-F-G  G  G  C/G-G  G
I wanna kiss the bride yeah!
        A       Dm7             Dm7   C     G/B
Long before she met him she was mine, mine, mine.
C/E          F     C/F-F                 C/G - G - C/G - G
Don't say "I do".         Say "bye, bye, bye"
           C/G  G           C  C/E  F  C/E  F  Fsus-F-G  G  G  C/G-G
And let me kiss the bride yeah!



     Dm7/F                                       Em7/G
Underneath her veil I could see a tear trickling down her pretty face.
             Dm7/F                                             Em7/G
And when she slipped on the ring I knew everything would never be the same again
           Dm7
But if the groom would have known he'd have had a fit -
          Am                     Bb      /F-/Bb   /F-/Bb   /C-/Bb
about his wife and the things we did.
                      F             C  F/D    C    G
And what I planned to say, yeah on her wed - ding day.
       C                            F      Gsus      G
Well I thought, I thought it but I kept it hid.
