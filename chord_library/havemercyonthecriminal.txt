Cm                 G7/B          Cm/Bb            Fm/Ab
Have you heard the dogs at night somewhere on the hill?
                  Cm/G         Cm                   G//  ///  ///  G/B-Eb/Bb-G/B
Chasing some poor criminal & I guess they're out to kill.
         Cm               G7/B            Eb/Bb         Fm/Ab
Oh there must be shackles on his feet and mother in his eyes.
               Cm/G                Cm                 G// /D-/G-/D G// /F-/D-/B
Stumbling thru devil-dark with the hound pack in full cry.


CHORUS:   Ab /  /   /C /Eb /F  Bb   /  /  /D /F /G     Cm
     Have mercy    -   on  the criminal    -    who is running from the law.
Ab      /C    /Eb   /F     Bb      /      /  /D /F /G        Cm
Are you blind   -   to the wind of change?         Don't you hear him anymore?
Ab7     /F /Eb      /Ab   Ab7  / /  /Ab /G /Gb  Fm
Praying Lord    you gotta help me.              I am never gonna sin again
Cm   Cm         Bb          Ab7                   G7                      Cm  G7
Just take these chains from round my legs.  Sweet Jesus I'll be your friend.



             Cm            G7/B
Now have you ever seen the white teeth gleam -
                Cm/Bb             Fm/Ab
     while you lie on a cold damp ground?
                               Cm/G
You're taking in the face of a rifle butt
               Cm               G //  ///  ///  G/B-Eb/Bb-G/B
     while the wardens hold you down.
           Cm           G7/B                     Eb/Bb               Fm/Ab
And you've never seen a friend in years.  Oh, it turns your heart to stone.
                           Cm/G
You jump the walls and the dogs run free,
             Cm                    G // /D-/G-/D G// /F-/D-/B
     and the grave's gonna be your home.


{Repeat Chorus}
