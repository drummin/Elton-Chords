You're a stranger to me

         F                Dm
Then you give me your life

Dm        C\F    Bb
I toss it to one side

F			   C\F
Still you're sweeter to me

F                       Dm  Dm F\C Bb  C
When we lie on the shore

It's warm where you are

But my lips just don't burn

  Dm      F       Bb
I feel so insecure

When you try to be kind

Behi_________ nd me

      Dm               F
There ain't no easy way

   C\F       Eb\F  Dm
To learn how to fly

  Dm        F\C       Bb
I hope that I can kill

F                 
When I turn around you're there
