Eb                  Bbm7          Db               Ab
I once knew all the answers.   I stood on certain ground.
Bbm7              Ab          Db            Ab               Db      Bbm7  Ab  Eb
A picture of true happiness.  Confidence so effortless.  No brighter could be found.
Eb                 Bbm7           Db          Ab
I never asked the questions that trouble me today.
Bbm7             Ab           Db                 Ab            Db      Bbm7 Ab   Eb
I knew all there was to know. Love worn lightly, put on show.  Conquest on  dis-play.



{Chorus} Db                          Ab               Eb     Ab  Db      Eb/G Ab
     And who would have thought his love could be so good?   Not me.     Not  me.
        Db             Ab             Eb      Ab  Db      Eb/G Ab
     My secrets and my passions understood.   Not me.     Not  me.
     Eb/Bb                                 Bb
     Who would have guessed he'd throw his world away
             Db/Eb                       Eb           Ab | Db * * * | * * * Eb | Ab |
          to  be   with someone till his dying day?   Not  me.              Not  me.



Eb                Bbm7        Db                 Ab
I shall not envy lovers, but long for what they share.
Bbm7             Ab           Db                   Ab
An empty room is merciless.  Don't be surprised if I confess ñ
         Db       Bbm7   Ab   Eb
      I need some com - fort there.


    {Repeat Chorus}


Coda:
    Ab  Db          Eb  Ab
But not me.    Ohh, not me.
