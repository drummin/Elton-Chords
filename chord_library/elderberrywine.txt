	  Bb
There's a fly in the window

  Bb
A dog in the yard

      Ab		   Eb\Ab
And a year since I saw you

	  Bb
There's a trunk in the corner

  Bb
I keep all my letters

    Ab
My bills and demands I keep too


	Gm	       Bb\F
Well I can't help thinking

 Eb
About the times

D7		   Gm
You were a wife of mine

	     Bb
You aimed to please me

		  Eb
Cooked black-eyed peas-me

		    Bb  Eb\Bb Bb  Eb\Bb  Bb
Made elderberry wine


F
Drunk all the time

F		     Eb\Bb     Bb  Eb\Bb Bb  Eb\Bb  Bb
Feeling fine on elderberry wine

F
Those were the days

F
We'd lay in the haze

   Eb\Bb          Bb    Eb\Bb Bb  Eb\Bb  Bb
Forget depressive times

F
How can I ever get it together

    Eb\Bb         Bb   Eb\Bb Bb  Eb\Bb  Bb
Without a wife in line

F
To pick the crop and get me hot

           Eb\Bb Bb Eb\Bb Bb  Eb\Bb  Bb  Eb\Bb  Bb  Eb\Bb 
On elderberry wine


    	Bb
Round a tree in the summer

  Bb
A fire in the fall

     Eb
Flat out when they couldn't stand

    Bb
The bottle went round

       Bb
Like a woman down south

       Eb
Passed on from hand to hand


	Gm	       Bb\F
Well I can't help thinking

 Eb
About the times

D7		   Gm
You were a wife of mine

	     Bb
You aimed to please me

		  Eb
Cooked black-eyed peas-me

		    Bb  Eb\Bb Bb  Eb\Bb  Bb
Made elderberry wine

(CHORUS 2x)

              Elderberry wine.
