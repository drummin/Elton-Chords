The Gods Love Nubia
{Words and Music by Elton John & Tim Rice}


        C               F                 Am7             D    *    G   *    
Take me in my dreams recurring.  Cheerful as a childhood dance.
      C * Eb       Bb/E     F   *  *  F#dim    | C/G *   G6   G  | C     |   
Into one  -  more taste of freedom.    One  more longing backward glance.



        C             F                   Am7                D    *    G   *    
In the sway of somber music   -   I shall never, never understand.
        C *    Eb     Bb/E     F   *  *  F#dim | C/G *      G6  G | C     |   
Let me slip in   -   into the sweeter    chorus  of    that oth-er land.



     F                     C
The gods love Nubia.  The beautiful.  The golden.
    G                           C      Dm/C    C/E
The radiant.  The fertile.  The gentle and the blessed.
     Fm              C/E
The pain of Nubia is only of the moment.
    D                              G           C/G    G
The desolate.  The suffering.  The plundered.  The oppressed.



     F                    C
The gods love Nubia, the glorious creation.
    G                    C        Dm/C    C/E
The songs roll sweetly across the harvest plain.
     Fm               C/E
The tears of Nubia, a passing aberration.
      D7                         G     Am/G   G7
They wash into the river and are never cried again




     F                   C
The gods love Nubia, we have to keep believing.
     G                      C      Dm/C       C/E
The scattered and divided.  We are still it's heart.
     Fm              C
The fall of Nubia, ephemeral and fleeting.
      E7   E7/G#   Am      C/G        F        G     C
The spirit always burning though the flesh is torn apart.
