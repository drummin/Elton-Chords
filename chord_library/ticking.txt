F                         Bb/F                  F  
Promising to hurt no one, providing they were still

Fourteen people lying dead in a bar they called the Kicking Mule

But they pumped you full of rifle shells as you stepped out the door

Oh you danced in death like a marionette on the vengeance of the law

"You've slept too long in silence" Mama said

Remember Mama said Ticking, ticking
