[Intro]:
MELODY:  A G E C G  D C A F C  
CHORDS:  C          Dm\F       C\G  G G

MELODY:  A G E C G  Bb(chord) C A F C   
CHORDS:  C          Bb		       Bb\F  F F  

   C                                 C/E
We bet on our lives and we bet on the horses
          F
In that upstairs apartment
         C   
On Orlando and 4th
           G                 Am            C/G 
And the rent was due and the rent man was knocking
          F        
Like a Chinese proverb
         C/G C/G C/G G    F 
We were always searching

Nightlife's a no-win but nobody noticed
How we killed off the bottles
Looking good on the surface
The dog days barked and the house cat got old
We were Bonnie and Clyde
In the emperor's new clothes

         Am
And the tears never came
           G/B 
They just stayed in our eyes
       F/C                                C   G/B
We refused to admit that we wore this disguise
       Am
Every inch of us growing
       Bb6 
Like Pinocchio's nose
      A+        A          Dm C/E F  G    C       F/C   C    
As we walked around in the emperor's new clothes

We flew by our wits and by the seat of our pants
In the state of illusion
In the nation of chance
And the repo was hauling the wreck we'd been driving
As the dashboard Madonna
Smiled back at us kindly

We cheated the system never batting an eyelid
Seeing only the good
Through the holes in our shoes
And our halos were rusty but we wore them proudly
We were two little gods
In the emperor's new clothes
   
[Chorus]

[Play Verse 1 & Verse 2 Instrumental only up till...]
We were Bonnie and Clyde
In the emperor's new clothes

[Chorus] (at the last line of the chorus play the following:)

       A+        A         Dm C/E F  G      Bb   F/A    Fm7/Ab  C/G
As we walked around in the emperor's new clothes
Dm C/E F  G    Bb   F/A    Fm7/Ab  C/G
emperor's new clothes
Dm C/E F  G    C        F/C C 
emperor's new clothes
