G                       Am
Oh Jessie I'd like to be

C            G\D                G G C C C 
One of those men upon the screen

G                          C    G\B     D7
With an elegant lady and a cafe in Paris

Am G\B  C          G\D             G G C C C
Serving Pernot and Kalua with cream


G                Am
You can see it I know

C                  G\D                  G G C C C 
All the doors have been closed in my face

G                     C C\B D7
And the drinks at the Casbah

Am  G\B C     G\D            G
Run a mile or more from this place



    Bm                  Em
And oh Jessie won't you look at the planes

        Bm               Em
Tell me, oh Jessie, is it true what they say

               Eb               G
That there's a capital G in the name of the game

        Em                    F           D
And the runway's a home for my silver-red plane



      C D                          G C
And oh, won't you look at the planes

D               G
Riding down the skyway

C                  D
Jessie ain't those wings just fine

G        G\F      G\E     G\D Am D
Don't it make you want to fly    someday

G Am C G\B Em D



G                  Am
Why friend am I so still

C          G\D                  G G C C C 
Tied to my job with time to kill

G                                 C       G\B D
Do I still bear the traces of old Don Quixote

        C          G\D           G
Tilting giants on imaginary hills

(REFRAIN)

      C D                          G C
And oh, won't you look at the planes

D               G
Riding down the skyway

C                  D
Jessie ain't those wings just fine

G        G\F      G\E     G\D Am D
Don't it make you want to fly    someday
