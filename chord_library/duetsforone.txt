        Ab/Eb - Eb                                        Ab
Look at you,         could I have been so foolish and so green?
                                    Bb(add2) - Bb     Bb(add2) - Bb 
A face that smiled at every passing scene.
        Ab/Eb - Eb                                        Ab
Look at you,         you're lost behind the web of woven time.
                                    Bb(add2) - Bb     Bb(add2) - Bb
When each emotion pinballed in your mind.
        Cm7                                    Fm7
Look at me, I'm happy now I see your face and smile.
                                 Bb(add2) - Bb     Bb(add2) - Bb
I was the judge and jury at your trial.
        Cm7                                       Fm7
Look at me,  I know the road ahead will twist and turn.
                                  G7sus - G
Now I have the time to stand and learn


CHORUS:
G7          C                    E                       E - E7
But you and I have come so far   -   with a shaken faith.
Am                                F                       Fmaj7 -Dm/F
From the pain of a broken heart   -   to a feeling great.
C/G             E/G#            Am        F
Feel like   -   life has just begun.
C/E   Dm/F   C/G    Dm/A    Cmaj7/G   Dm/G      C
No    more   sing - ing      du   -   ets   for one.


I hold your picture here beside the bed.
You had a party raging in your head.
Look at me, I look at you with vacancy and hurt.
And here today all I can do is learn.
Look at me, I'm happy now I see your face and smile.
I was the judge and jury at your trial.
Look at me, I know the road ahead will twist and turn.
Now I have the time to stand and learn.


{Repeat Chorus}

            Ab5           Bb5               C
I have this picture of me looking at you - looking at me.
            Ab5           Fm            G7
And I would like to say "Goodbye, sweet memory."


{Repeat chorus and then its last line three times}
