THERE IS STILL A LITTLE LOVE (John/Taupin)
F#m                      E6 
There is still a little love left 
     Dmaj7          C#sus  C#7 
For me in your heart.......... 
F#m                     E6 
Even though it seems to you 
           Dmaj7     C#sus  C#7 
that we are far apart..........
E                         A 
You can turn your eyes to other guys 
E                  A 
Ignore me on the street 
     D                 Bm 
But don't forget it's bound to show 
  C#sus            C#   C#7 
If we should ever meet, and
F#                      A#m 
There is still a little love left  
       B            C#sus  C#7 
For me in your heart.......... 
A#m                  D#m7            G#7       C#7 
You can use a little love to make a brand new start 
              F#      A#7      D#m   F#/C#    B 
For no matter how you try, you just cannot deny 
          F#             C#           Bm  C#sus  C#7 
There is still a little love in your heart..........
F#m                 E6 
But you're far too proud to say 
     Dmaj7         C#sus  C#7 
What's on your mind.......... 
F#m                    E6 
I can read you like a story book 
       Dmaj7          C#sus  C#7 
Do you think I'm blind..........
E                  A 
For every place I seem to be 
E                     A 
You seem to be there too 
  D              Bm 
Standing in the wings of love 
    C#sus            C#   C#7 
And waiting for your cue, and
F#                      A#m 
There is still a little love left  
       B            C#sus  C#7 
For me in your heart.......... 
A#m                  D#m7            G#7       C#7 
You can use a little love to make a brand new start 
              F#      A#7      D#m   F#/C#    B 
For no matter how you try, you just cannot deny 
          F#             C#           Bm  C#sus  C#7 
There is still a little love in your heart......Yeah
 
F#                      A#m 
There is still a little love left  
       B            C#sus  C#7 
For me in your heart.......... 
A#m                  D#m7            G#7       C#7 
You can use a little love to make a brand new start 
              F#      A#7      D#m   F#/C#    B 
For no matter how you try, you just cannot deny 
          F#             C# 
There is still a little love 
          A#7           D#m 
There is still a little love 
           B             C#           Bm6   F# 
There is still a little love in your heart....
