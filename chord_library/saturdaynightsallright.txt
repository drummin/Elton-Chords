G
It's getting late have you seen my mates

   F
Ma tell me when the boys get here

     C
It's seven o'clock and I want to rock

	 G
Want to get a belly full of beer


   G	
My old man's drunker than a barrel full of monkeys

       F
And my old lady she don't care

   C
My sister looks cute in her braces and boots

  G
A handful of grease in her hair

Dm

C
Don't give us none of your aggravation

   Bb
We had it with your discipline

F
Saturday night's alright for fighting

C
Get a little action in


C
Get about as oiled as a diesel train

Bb
Gonna set this dance alight

       F
`Cause Saturday night's the night I like

C   				 G
Saturday night's alright alright alright  

Eb6  Bb F  G   G  G\D F  G   G  G\D F   
Whoo________!


	     G
Well they're packed pretty tight in here tonight

    F
I'm looking for a dolly who'll see me right

      C
I may use a little muscle to get what I need

      G
I may sink a little drink and shout out "She's with me!"


  G
A couple of the sound that I really like

        F
Are the sounds of a switchblade and a motorbike

      C
I'm a juvenile product of the working class

      G
Whose best friend floats in the bottom of a glass

Dm

F
Saturday, saturday, saturday, 

 	 C
Saturday night's alright.
