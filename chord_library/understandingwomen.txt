Gm           D7/F#           Bb/F                    Cm/Eb
Rolling over trying to sleep   -   and understanding women.
D                         D7             Gm                               G7
Thinking of you out there  -  somewhere,    looking for a new beginning.
Cm                        D7          Gm             Gm/F
Just let me be the final word in the book we haven't written.

I won't be another page    -    in understanding women.


Gm               D7/F#  Bb/F                   Cm/Eb
I could drive to Mexico   -   on understanding women.
D             D7               Gm                           G7
Throw myself against the waves  -  and answer up to heaven.
Cm                      D7         Gm                           Gm/F
How come her heart's so stubborn?      And what's so wrong with giving?
C/E             D        Cm7/Eb        D7            Gm    {replay intro)
Ask the big sky talking     -    about understanding women.


G/F                 Cm            F                 Bb
And I'm not just anyone who ever stood outside your door.
G/F             Cm               F       Bb
And I'm not any man you've ever known before.
Bb7                                   Eb
Don't judge this picture by the frame - every man is not the same.
F                                                 Gm {replay intro & fade}
Some men reach beyond the pain - of understanding women.
