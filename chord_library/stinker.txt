Intro: /G...     /F-/G...     /F-/E-/D   /G... 


G                C/G - G               G7 - C/G
Say what you will   -    but I'm a stinker.  
G              G7         C/G    G     G7
   I come crawling up out of my hole.
C7               F/C - C7                         G/B               C      A7/C#
Dirt in my toes,          dirt up my nose - I'm a perfect curse to pest control.
D7 - G                  C/G - G            G7   C/G - G 
        Seeds and weeds         and muddy meals -       
G          G7   C/G  G      G7
crawling around the earth.
C7                       F/C  C7                    G/B          C       A7/C#
Down in the ground where the  sun don't pound. Oh I hibernate in English turf.



CHORUS:
D7                       Em      /D  /B - C               Em
Better believe it, I'm a stinker.         Burning vermin stink.
G7/B             C         G7   /B  C     
Watch me get as high as a heat wave honey.  
A7  /B  /C   /C#    D          C
Tell me what your  hound dogs think.



Set in my styles with a beady eye.  I got connections with the underground.
Call me a common rodent boy sitting here safe and sound.


{Repeat Chorus}


Some mole hill mother sauntered by acting like the ace of spades.
Don't give that cutey no reason to shoot me -
     when I'm living on the eggs she laid.



{Repeat Chorus}
