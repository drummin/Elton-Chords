Cm
There's another one due in three month's time

			 Ab
She'll have to paint the spare room blue

Cm
She'll work a little overtime

			      Ab
And hope it all works out for Frank and her

Ab6\F				F7\G
If she can keep him home nights

 G		Cm
Away from those factory girls


Cm	
And the gas bills come and the money burns

			Ab
And Frank just keeps complaining

Cm
How little they both earn


And mother drops by Mondays

	Ab
Just to nag about the world

Ab6\F
Then she stays to nag at Dallas

Cm\G	   G	       Cm
`Cause she hates those Texas girls


Bb   Eb
Poor cow

Eb
You'll get your dumb man

F		
You'll see your whole life coming at you

	Ab
In the back of his hand

Bb   Eb
Poor cow

Eb
It's a monkey see town

F
You'll walk down the aisle

		Ab
In the hand me down gown

	Bb   Cm  
Of some poor cow

Oh them rich bitch girls

               Gm7\Bb
Ain't like our lass

    Gdim\Bb F\A       
Got no      spine for labour

        Fm\Ab
Like us working class

Cm       G\B
Us gamey lot

	      Gm7\Bb
Still got our pride

   Gdim\Bb F\A
We got our health

			   Fm\Ab
It's just the truth that's died
