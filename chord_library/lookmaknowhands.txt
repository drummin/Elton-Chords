I'll take a rainy day
	A		E
To make a champagne shower
	 	C#m
Poach some horn and tusk
		A	B
To build an ivory tower
E/G#		A
Been to Philadelphia 	D	A
The day it was closed
E		C#m
I walked to New Orleans
		A B	E
Down a Louisiana road
(same)
The skeletons they hung from the bushes and the
trees
But not a skull among 'em said boo to me
In a time of wine and cheap cigars
I'm on top of the world
Top of the world Ma
D
Look Ma no hands
A
Look Ma ain't life grand
E			B
I'm a super power, I'm a handy man
Bm			A
Didn't I turn out, didn't I turn out to be
G
Everything you wanted Ma
	A		Bsus4 B
Ain't you proud of me

It takes a silver tongue
To have the Midas touch
Not your alchemist
Making gold from rust

Been down in Roswell
When the Martians came
I sailed to Mandeville
Across Lake Pontchartrain
