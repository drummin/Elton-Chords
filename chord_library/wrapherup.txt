Roaring twenties, molls and vamps

This is one of the simplest songs of Elton's career chordwise.  
It can, though, sound very impressive with proper improv and when played using some form of synthesizer.  Play around with it.

NOTE:  I have tried my best to decipher all of the women's names at the end.  They were not part of the original words.
Some of them which were unclear could be matched with the list from the ROCKET MAN book.  
If anyone has information on the missing names, please e-mail us.
