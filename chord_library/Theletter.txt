Dear Billy,

       Eb             Bb/D  
I must seem a distant memory

         Cm   Cm/Bb  Ab
Which is probably a good thing

       Eb               Bb/D       Cm   Ab
And it will have been a long, long time

      Eb                   Bb/D 
And I will have missed you growing

     Cm       Cm/Bb      Ab
And I'll have missed you crying

    Eb        Bb/D       Eb 
And I'll have missed you laugh


G                             Cm
Missed your stamping and your shouting

G                         Cm 
I have missed telling you off

    Cm/Bb   Ab                    G 
But please, Billy, know that I was always there

      Ab       Cm            Bb
I was with you through everything


            Eb     Bb/D             Cm  Cm/Bb Ab
And please, Billy, know that I will al---ways be

Eb            Bb    Cm  Ab 
Proud to have known you

Eb                  Bb/D
Proud that you were mine

Cm       Cm/Bb Ab
Proud in everything

             Eb         G           Cm
And you must promise me this, Billy

G                Cm
In everthing you do

G         Cm        Ab    
Always be yourself, Billy

         Eb    Bb/D     Cm
And you always will be true


cm     Cm/Bb Ab
Love you forever

         B           Eb
Love you forever    -Mam
