G                   C/G
Must have been the right month
Eb                F
Must have been a good time
C							     G
Must have counted every cloud in the sky that night
       Eb     F        G
Every single glass of wine

G                      C/G
Must have learned some home truths
Eb                F
Sitting in that cool grass
C							     G
Must have counted every blade in that emerald field
        Eb     F          C
Every shooting star that passed

             F    Eb    F    C              
Should have had a talk with God
         F      Eb   F   C  
Sitting in the great unknown
          F      Ab             C/G
Watching all the lovers in the world get together
Dm                 G
Sitting in Heaven all alone

Eb                             Bb/D
And we were love's knot after summer
F                      C/E
Tied together in the dead of winter 
Eb                      F          C      Eb/C - Bb/C
Wrapped up with spring fever in the air
Eb                      Bb/D
Bound together in the autumn
F                    C/E
Every month means a little something
     D       Ab      Bb        C      D - Ab - Bb - C 
But January is the month that cares

G                            C/G
Must have kissed you 'till I hurt you
Eb                F
Must have been a wild night
C							     G
Must have rolled in the ashes at the break of day
          Eb     F        G
Rag dolls in the morning light

G                  C/G
Must have found a secret place
Eb            F
Hiding in our own world
C							          G
Must have counted every smile on your sweet, sweet lips
        Eb     F       C
Every single sound we heard
