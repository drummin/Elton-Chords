THE TIDE WILL TURN FOR REBECCA (John/Taupin)

         G        Bm/F#       G7
Can you hear the floorboards crying
     Am7          D7     G
In a room on the second floor
                Bm/F#     Em
That used to be owned by someone who's no one
       Fmaj7      Cmaj7    Am7   D
But he don't live there anymore...

       Fmaj9               Em
Only Rebecca clasping her head in her knees
Fmaj9               Em
Trying to work out what it's about
         Bm             Em  G7/D  Cmaj7  Dsus
And why someone had to leave.................

    D7           G                       G7/F
But dry up your tears, stop counting the years
                   Cmaj7                   Am7   D
Don't worry what's coming, forget all your fears..

       Fmaj9     Cmaj7 G/B    E
And the tide will turn for Rebecca
       Fmaj9     Cmaj7 G/B    E
And the tide will turn for Rebecca
              Cmaj7                 A7
Her life will change, her hopes rearrange
     Bm                  C  Dsus  G6
Into something that might really matter

Fmaj7  Em7  Am7  Dsus  D7
(Instrumental)...........

       G  Bm/F#       G7
She's all alone in a world of her own
       Am7       D7       G
With a key that fits her lonely world
                 Bm/F#     Em
You won't need a crowd to shout out aloud
        Fmaj7   Cmaj7         Am7   D
What she says deserves to be heard...

       Fmaj9               Em
Only Rebecca clasping her head in her knees
Fmaj9               Em
Trying to work out what it's about
         Bm             Em  G7/D  Cmaj7  Dsus
And why someone had to leave.................

    D7           G                       G7/F
But dry up your tears, stop counting the years
                   Cmaj7                   Am7   D
Don't worry what's coming, forget all your fears..

       Fmaj9     Cmaj7 G/B    E
And the tide will turn for Rebecca
       Fmaj9     Cmaj7 G/B    E
And the tide will turn for Rebecca
              Cmaj7                 A7
Her life will change, her hopes rearrange
     Bm                  C  Dsus  G6
Into something that might really matter
