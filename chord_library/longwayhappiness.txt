Long Way From Happiness
by: Elton John and Bernie Taupin

intro: Csus/D - C/E - Bb - C

Csus/D         C/E
I guess you're okay
Bb                            C
You seem to feel better these days
Dm
I've known you for so long
                Bb                 Am     Dm
I've seen your brightness go from blue to grey

Csus/D          C/E
You know that's true
Bb                                 C
You can shake your head but I can prove
Dm
I've seen things through your eyes
          Bb                 Am       Dm
You think you win but in the end you lose

Bb
And there's no second guess
            F	
We take no second bets
         C	                      F
Chances are we're a long way from happiness
            Bb
Don't cover up the road to love
                 F
With words that can't express
           C            C#dim	    Dm
The truth implies you're high and dry
              Bb           C    Csus/D
And you're a long way from happiness

Csus/D        C/E
I'm one step behind
Bb                            C
Looking out for you all the time
Dm
I'll put my faith in you
                Bb                 Am       Dm
And steer you clear of love that leaves you blind
