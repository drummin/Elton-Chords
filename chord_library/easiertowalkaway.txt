[Intro (where each || represents one measure of 4/4)]:
| Bb | Bb |

V1:
Bb			   F/A
Every time you turn around
Gm			Bb
You wear another face
Eb			Eb(add9)
Every time I look away
Bb			Eb(add9)
I find a hiding place

V2:
Bb				  F/A
If you knew me like you knew him
Gm				Gm7
You would know just how I feel
Eb				    Eb(add9)
Slipping through someone's fingers
Bb		  Eb/Bb    Bb
Falling under someone's wheels

[Chorus]:
Bb		    F    Bb  F
It's easier to walk away
		Gm
Better off to face the facts
Cm			     Ab
When love holds you up for ransom
F		Eb/Bb    Bb
Walk away and don't look back

[1st time: go to Verse 3. 2nd/3rd time: continue from here]
Eb(add9)     Bb
		   F
Its easier to walk away
		Gm	   Cm
Cover up and fade to black
				Ebm6/Gb   F
When love scars and leaves you branded
	      Eb/Bb	 Bb
Walk away and don't look back

V3:
Never seen you looking back through
Smiling eyes and tears
Never knew you holding on to
Memories and fears

V4:
Just release me I can't take it
Can't you see a change has come
Strangled by infatuation
Buried under someone's thumb

[Chorus] (follow instructions and go to coda)
