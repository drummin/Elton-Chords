----------------------------------------------------------
   
---Intro---

A - G - D (repeat several times)


---Verse 1---

  A
I remember it like it was yesterday

G		     F
Snow in the park and skaters on the ice

E		         D
Long black cars standing side-by-side

A/C#	       Bm      D     G/D    D
Loading up the boys at night


---Verse 2---

Turned up our collars to the chill of the wind
Caught an innocent smile from a taxi at the lights
Not something you'd see on a New York street
It's such an uncommon sight



---chorus---

      Bb			 C/Bb
But I wouldn't have it any other way

     F/A		  Bb		      F/A   C#dim Dm7 
This city's got a thing about it, don't try to understand it

D                 Gm7
New York City I'd really like to stay

C
New York City I wouldn't have you

Bb	   F/A	    Eb  Edim    Bb/F    F
I wouldn't have you any other way


A - G - D (repeat several times)


---Verse 3---

Oh the subway rumbled underneath
Italian lights where Joey Gallo died
And the man on the door down at 54's
Letting only the pretty inside


---Verse 4---

I'd wake with a stranger under the covers
Late in the day and longing for the night
Just like the snowfall there's so many bodies
But somehow it feels so right


[Chorus]


---Bridge---

    Dm		   A
And I can feel the magic

    Dm		   A
And read a million lips

   Bb		     F/A
No matter what might happen

	Eb    Edim       G/C    C
They'll never sink this ship
 

[Verse Instrumental 2x]


[Chorus]


---Final Line---

Bb	   F/A	    Eb   Edim   Bb/F     F
I wouldn't have you any other way
