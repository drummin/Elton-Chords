    D   *     *       G       D        *   *  D7  
My bulldog is barking in the backyard -
      G         *       *        *       E7    *  *  *
     enough to raise a dead man from his grave.
      D/F#   *     *        *       B    *  *  B7
And I can't concentrate on what I'm doing. 
   E7        *       /B   /E     A  *  *
Disturbance gonna to crucify my days.
/B  /C#  D    /A      /D  /A     /D  /A
And the days they get longer and longer.
Am/E  D7/F#     G7        /D   /G      /F#    E7-9  E7/B  E7
       And  the nighttime is a time of little use.
/B     D   /A  /D   /C#    B7    /F#
For I just get ug - ly and older. 
/B  /F#     E7    /B    A7       /B - /C#  D     /A  /D  /A
     I get juiced on Mateus and just hang loose.


CHORUS:    Bm  *          *        *       G7   *  *  *
And I get  -  bombed for breakfast in the morning.
       Bm     *   *      *       G7  *  *  *
I get bombed for dinner time and tea.
            D     *           A      *      G    *    *    *
I dress in rags, smell a lot,   and have a real good time.
       D  *     *  *  A7  *    /B /C#     D  *  G  *  D  *  *  *
I'm a genuine example  -  of a so-cial disease.


    D  /A    /D   /A   /D  /A  
My landlady lives in a caravan.
Am/E  D7/F#     G7      /D       /G   /F#    E7-9  E7/B  E7
           Well that is when she isn't in my arms.
/B      D      /A      /D      /C#   B7    /F#
And it seems I pay the rent in human kindness.
/B  /F#    E7     /B    E7      Gsus/C#     A   *
    But my liquor also helps to grease her palms.
G/B   A/C#    D   /A     /D  /A      /D     /A
      And the ladies are all getting wrinkles.
Am/E  D7/F#       G7   /D  /G  /F#     E7-9  E7/B  E7
      And they're falling apart at the seams.
/B     D    /A  /D  /C#    B7    /F#
Well I just get high on tequila.
/B  /F#      E7   /B   A7        /B-/C#  D     /A  /D  /A
    And see visions of vineyards in  my dreams.
 
{Repeat Chorus, Instrumental Verse & Repeat Chorus again}
