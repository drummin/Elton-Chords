Intro: Dm  C  Bb  Em  E/G#  Am   
 
(e)   (a)  (c)    (e) (C) (a)(e) Dm   C 
Your life stepped lightly out of hands

     Bb               C                 F   Em E/G#  Am
When no one's looking out you understand

(e)  (a)   (c)(a)(E)   (C) (c) (c) (a)   (e) Dm   C   
Your world was a wheel but the cog ceased to turn

    Bb                      F/A         Gm7(no 3rd) Gm7+A/D  C  
The bottom fell out and our fingers got burned

    (No A)
    A7/C#     Bb7                  Bb7/C  Dm7               Dm7/C
And there's a cold, cold highway that the wind whistles down

          Bb7                 Bby7/C   Dm7            Dm7/C
Where the corners turn blind like the graveyard ground

        Gm7               Gm7/G# Am/7      Dm   Dm/C
Oh your black icy stare once cut down my friend

       F+G/F   F/A       F/C F/F         Bb+G            F/A  Gm7(no 
3rd)  
In the deepest dark winter      when the world seemed to end


Segue(1st & 2nd):  Em  E/G#  A(no 3rd) Single notes from below MidC 
progress up: e a c# e  e a c# e  e a c# e


(Tacit)
(e)(a)(c) (e) (c)(c) (c) (a) (e) Dm  C
Every new version of the way of life

           Bb                         C                 F  Em  E/# Am 
Leaves you reckless and searching for stars in the night

(e)  (a)  (c) (a) (e) (c)  (c)  (c) (a) (e)Dm  C  
But whose kid are you when they finally decide

    Bb                        F/A          Gm7(no 3rd)  Gm7+A/D   C
The lifestyle you led and the way that you died


(To Chorus)

F                 Dm  F    Bb                      Bb7/Ab
But they're oh so simple, they're still trying to tell

    G/B(nat)                   C           F    Em  E/G#
The difference for you between heaven and hell

Am                          Dm          Dm/C
To glorify something, your legends are found

G/B                           C           C/Bb    C/A  Em  E/G# Am
But all they bought you was a hole in the ground


(e)   (a) (c) (e) (c) (a) (e) Dm   C
Years rolling by just like a dream

Bb                        C          F  Em  E/G# Am  
I'm partly human and I'm partly machine

 (e)    (a)  (c) (a) (e)  (c) (c)  (c) (a) (e) Dm  C  
They've lost you and fate put your name on a stone

   Bb                            F/A            Gm7(no 3rd) Gm7+A/D  C 
Perhaps now my friend they might leave you alone


Fine (3rd): Em E/G#  A(no 3rd) e a c# e
