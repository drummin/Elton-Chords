F		     C7
Sometimes you dream, sometimes it seems

C7		C     F\D C\E F  F\E
There's nothing there at all

    Dm			 Am
You just seem older than yesterday

	   Bb			   C    C F\D C\E
And you're waiting for tomorrow to call


    F			    C7
You draw to the curtain and one thing's for certain

       C7	    C      F\D  C\E F  C\E
You're cozy in your little room

    Dm			       Am
The carpet's all paid for, God bless the TV

      Bb		         C
Let's go shoot a hole in the moon


C F\D C\E F             Dm\F
Whoa  And Roy Rogers is riding tonight

  Bb				F  F C\E F\D 
Returning to our silver screens

C	   C   F\D C\E  F
Comic book charac- ters never grow old

Bb		       G\B	    C
Evergreen heroes whose stories were told

	 Dm		       Am
Oh the great sequin cowboy who sings of the plains

   Bb			     G\B	  C Dm\C C
Of roundups and rustlers and home on the ra_______nge

Dm		  Am
Turn on the T.V., shut out the lights

    Bb	      Bb F\A C\G F Bb\F  F  
Roy Rogers is riding to-ni_____ght

F		       C7
Nine o'clock mornings, five o'clock evenings

    C7        C    F\D C\E F  C\E
I'd liven the pace if I could

       Dm			Am
Oh I'd rather have a ham in my sandwich than cheese

       Bb			C7   C F\D 
But complaining wouldn't do any good


C\E F			 C7
Lay back in my armchair, close eyes and think clear

C7         C   F\D   C\E F  C\E
I can hear hoofbeats ahead

Dm		     Am
Roy and Trigger have just hit the hilltop

          Bb			      C
While the wife and the kids are in bed
