	E	        B\D#
Turn me loose from your hands

       A B    	      E
Let me fly to distant lands

     F#\A#  		     A
Over green fields, trees and mountains

E\B	B7	   E
Flowers and forest fountains

A	       E\B   B7	    E
Home along the lanes of the skyway


	 E		 B\D#
For this dark and lonely room

	     A  E\B  B7	     E
Projects a sha___dow cast in gloom

		F#\A#
And my eyes are mirrors

       A
Of the world outside

	 E\B
Thinking of the way

B7		  E
That the wind can turn the tide

	  A
And these shadows turn

     E\B    B7   E
From purple into grey


	   A
For just a Skyline Pigeon

E\B		B7
Dreaming of the open

E
Waiting for the day

       A
He can spread his wings

    E\B  B7   E   G#7\D#
And fly away again

     C#m D#7	 	G#m
Fly away skyline pigeon fly

	    A
Towards the dreams

       E\B          B7    E    G#7\D#
You've left so very far behind

     C#m D#7	 	G#m
Fly away skyline pigeon fly

	    A
Towards the dreams

       E\B          B7    E
You've left so very far behind


	    E
Just let me wake up in the morning

       G#m\D#
To the smell of new mown hay

	     A		      D7
To laugh and cry, to live and die

       E
In the brightness of my day

	  F#\A#
I want to hear the pealing bells

	   A
Of distant churches sing

	    E\B
But most of all please free me

B7		 E
From this aching metal ring

    A		  E\B		   E
And open out this cage towards the sun


	   A
For just a Skyline Pigeon

E\B		B7
Dreaming of the open

E
Waiting for the day

       A
He can spread his wings

    E\B  B7   E   G#7\D#
And fly away again

     C#m D#7	 	G#m
Fly away skyline pigeon fly

	    A
Towards the dreams

       E\B          B7    E    G#7\D#
You've left so very far behind

     C#m D#7	 	G#m
Fly away skyline pigeon fly

	    A
Towards the dreams

       E\B                   B7    E  B  C#m  E\B  A  E\B B7 E
You've left so very, so very far behi_____nd.
