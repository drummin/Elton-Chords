Dm                         Eb
I'm still in love with you - oh, shooting star.
Dm                          Eb             D
And when I start to wonder where you are, there you are.
Cm             Ab               A7    A/C#
There you are, shooting star.


Dm                          Eb
You may have seen me at the early show.
Dm                             Eb
I sat and watched you from the second row.
    D             Cm        Ab
Oh, you were mine long ago, way back when.
Eb/Db      Db/Eb        Eb/Db              Db/Eb
Even then, we both knew you'd go far - oh, shooting star.



F                          Em7      A   Dm                               F/G
With the spotlight shining in your eyes it's sometimes hard to find your way.
G/B  F               Esus   E7    Am          B/A
But maybe some night  you  might think of me, shooting star.
F                             Esus      E7           Am
And when that moment comes at last, and you remember who you are.
Abmaj7        Eb/Db           Db/Eb
Here I'll be, shooting star.  Shooting star.
Eb/Db         Db/Eb          G/F  F/G           G/F  F/G            C
Here I'll be, shooting star.     Shooting star.     Shooting star.
