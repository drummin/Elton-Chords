Intro : Ab/Db / / /     Gb/Db / / /     Ab/Db / / /     Gb/Db / / /



Ab/Db                Ebm/Db          Ab/Db                          Ebm/Db
I can't control this flesh and blood   -   that's wrapped around my bones.
                           Bbm            Ebm     Absus   Ab
It moves beneath me like a river into the great unknown.
Ab/Db              Ebm/Db       Ab/Db                      Ebm/Db
I stepped onto the moving stairs  -  before I could tie my shoes.
                                  Bbm                    Ebm      Ab7sus
Pried a harp out the fingers of a renegade who lived and died the blues.
        Ab               Bbm          Gb                          Ab7sus
And his promise made was never clear,    it just carved itself in me.
Ab  Absus  /       Ab     Bbm                 Gb               Ab7sus
    All I saw was frost inside my head on the night he said to me.


CHORUS:
Ab            Db        Ab/C          Bbm                     Ab/C
Someday we'll live like horses.  Free rein from your old iron fences.
                       Gb                 Db/Ab
There's more ways than one to regain your senses.
              Gb/Bb            Ab7/C  Fm/C  Db  {see below}
Break out the stalls and we'll live   like horses.


1: Db ///   ////   Ab/C ///   Bbm ///   Ebm/Gb / Ab /
   horses.
2: Db            Ab/C        Bbm
   horses - some day.   Free rein  {play rest of chorus)
3: Db ///   Bbm/Db / Gb/Db /   Db
   horses.


Ab/Db                    Ebm/Db     Ab/Db                       Ebm/Db
We're the victims of the heartbreak   -   that kept us short of breath.
                              Bbm               Ebm    Absus   Ab
Trapped above these bloodless streets without a safety net.
Ab/Db              Ebm/Db        Ab/Db                     Ebm/Db
I stood in line to join the trial  -  one more customer of fate.
                                    Bbm                Ebm                Ab7sus
Claimed a spoke in the wheel of the wagon train on the road to the Golden Gate.
       Ab                  Bbm           Gb                      Ab7sus
On the flat cracked desert I jumped ship.  It just made sense to me.
Ab   Absus      /          Ab    Bbm              Gb             Ab7sus
I've spent too long in the belly of the beast and now I shall be free.


{Repeat Chorus}
