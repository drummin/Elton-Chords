IN THE NAME OF YOU - ELTON JOHN

INTRO
Em7 - - D A
 (x4)

VERSE
Em                 A
 Got a penny in my pocket
G      D            A/C#
 And a dollar in my hand
B
 But I'll drop it in your tin cup
      A          G       Em
Cause you were a one man band
Em                 A
 If I could make a million
G       D  A/C#
On some TV show
B
 On the roulette wheel
     A     G     E
In a great big casino

CHORUS
D                 A
 I'd go ahead and do it
E              B
 But only if I knew
G#m                  C#m     B
I could go ahead and claim it
A              B
In the name of you
D                   A
 Whatever worth I'd choose
E                    B
 Whatever tricks I'd use
G#m                    C#m     B
 I would find a way to claim it
A      G       D  Em
In the name of you

VERSE
Em                 A
 I got my favorite hat
G         D         A/C#
With that snakeskin band
B
 When you need a little shake
     A      G       Em
I've put it in your hands
Em                    A
 To the bottom of the ocean
G       D      A/C#
I would surely dive
B
 To find the oldest oyster
         A       G       E
With the biggest pearl inside

CHORUS
D                 A
 I'd go ahead and do it
E              B
 But only if I knew
G#m                  C#m     B
I could go ahead and claim it
A              B
In the name of you
D                   A
 Whatever worth I'd choose
E                    B
 Whatever tricks I'd use
G#m                    C#m     B
 I would find a way to claim it
A      G       D  Em
In the name of you

Em7 - - - |

B            C#m
 I'd claim a confront
A            E
 I'd claim a tune
D#o7          G#7          C#m
 All the undiscovered territory
    B                F#/A# F#
Out there beyond the moon
