And   I   never thought I'd feel this way.  And as far as I'm concerned.
           G7sus      G7       Cm7          Abmaj7           Fm7/Bb

Ebmaj9      Ebmaj9/D               Abmaj7/C               Bb/Ab    Gm7     Cm7
Keep smiling,       keep shining - knowing you can always count on me, for sure.

{Instrumental}                     Well you came and opened    me, 
                G7sus        G7    Cm7          Abmaj7           Fm7/Bb
and now there's   so   much more I see.  And so   by   the way I thank you.
   Ebmaj9          Gm7        Cm7   Fm7                                Dm7(no 5)
And then  for the times when we're apart - well then close your eyes & know
                G7sus   G7      Cm7              Abmaj7           Fm7/Bb   Ab/Bb
