G 
Look at you in your monkey suit
G
Driving south, nothing left to prove
D
You come back here in your cowboy boots
D
Dressed to kill in your monkey suit
A 7 
Every pose you strike, every frame they shoot
G7 D Repeat Intro 3 times..
Shows you dressed to kill in your monkey suit


Build your ladder to the moon
Beat on that sacred drum
Trample on the hands of those
That cling to every rung
Every seed you crush beneath
Like stone ground in a mill
You never drew a decent breath
But you're just dressed to kill

[repeat chorus]
[repeat chorus]
