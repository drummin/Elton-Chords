	  A               D\A A
When it's springtime down in  Georgia

     A\C#	 A\C#   D
It's winter time up in Maine

        C#m		F#m
You can go from snow to sunshine

       A		  D
If you board a southbound train

        A          D\A A
You get used to taking orders

	 A\C# 	   
But it's sometimes kind of rough

      C#m		F#m
I got everything that a man could need

       A		   D
But it still ain't quite enough


	     A  D\A  A  A       A\C#    D
Taking about oh Georgia take me to your Southlands

  A                 F#m     E	    D
I sometimes feel my life is rolling on

A  D\A  A  A       A\C#         D
Oh Georgia lead me through your heartlands

  A	  E\G#	   F#m	    E      D    E   A    D\A A  A  A\C# D  D  A  A\E E  				 
I need to see them one more time before I'm gone


	  A              D\A A
When it's nighttime down in  Georgia

     A\C#       D
It's daytime in L.A.

	   C#m		 F#m
Where they never seem to do much

	 A		     D
But they sure got lots to say

	      A		    D\A A 
The times are changing down in  Georgia

	   A\C#           D
Though not always for the best

	C#m		 F#m
Give me thirty five good acres lord

	A		      D
And let progress take the rest

A  D\A A  A  A\C# D  D  A  A\E E
Mmm_____  Mmm______  Mmm________


A  D\A A   A       A\C#    D
Oh Georgia take me to your Southlands

  A		      F#m      E         D
I sometimes feel that life has passed me by

A  D\A  D  A       A\C#         D
Oh Georgia lead me through your heartlands

  A       E\G#     F#m      E      D    E A
I need to see them one more time before I die

A  D\A A  A  A\C# D  

  D                A               A\E  E A
I need to see them one more time before I die.
