Intro: Am7 Bm7 C Am7/(9)

Am7/(9)
The old gates are always locked
        D7
By the daughter of the keys
Am7/(9)
Sad eyes are fixed on the world
D7
From the balcony
          C              D/B
While the six o'clock procession
            D7/4/A              E4
Take their prayer books to the hall
     Am               D
It's sad to see them shed a tear
  C                Am7
Inside the convent walls

Am7/(9)
Red mountains around them
D7
Keep out those who'd come
Am7/(9)
But only birds and wild deer
D7
Share the lives of nuns
     C             D/B
For ladies who in kindness
          D7/4/A              E4
Burn the knowledge they have found
       Am              D
Their knowledge lies inside a hole
 C              Am
Buried in the ground

Chorus:
Am7                    D9
For the Sisters of the Cross
Am7                    D9
Seek the shadows that they have lost
G                   C
In the walls where their lives
G                C
Are protected by God
A7                 D9
But the feeling of love
A7                   D9
Is somehwere in your bones
C
Your body is wasted
         E4
When it should have been owned

Am7/(9)
The Mother of the mission bells
D7
Has lived here all her life
Am7/(9)
She never felt the hands of man
D7
Touch her in the night
           C           D/B
And the canopies that cover her
    D7/4/A        E4
So cold and so afraid
 Am             D
Thinking holy mothers die
       C               D
Like spinsters in the grave

Am7/(9)
To be single in the chapel
       D7
Praying knelt down on your knees
Am7/(9)
Where the corridors are echoing
D7
Their proud solemnity
         C            D/B
And the candle light against the glass
       D7/4/A          E4
Plays shadow chasing tricks
        Am                      D
As the young girls fall, their eyes in tears
   C            Am
Beside the crucifix
