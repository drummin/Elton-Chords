Am                        G
See my eyes and I see my arms
D                        Am
The seagulls say you've gone
F                               C
It was just a game of let's pretend
Bb                    C                 F  F7
And I whistle to the waves that lend me tears

 F              Dm                         A
Purple clouds, golden rain, yesterday has gone
       Gm        Bb          C
And a dandelion dies in the wind

Am                         G
If you're quick enough to rise
D                             Am
With the sleep still in your eyes
 F                                         C
You'll see the shadow of the sun above my mind
   Bb             C               F   F7
I know that only you can help me now....

 F              Dm                         A
Purple clouds, golden rain, yesterday has gone
       Gm        Bb          C
And a dandelion dies in the wind

D                              G/D
But a dandelion sighs, and it tries to tell the wind
      A              G          F             C
That crying's not a bad thing, worrying is a sin

Dm                         Bb
If they sent a cloud from heaven
A7                     Dm
I would ride into the skies
                     Bb
To escape all of my troubles
A7                     Dm   C7
And to cast away your lies....

 F                 Dm                 A
Purple rains have turn to gold, the clouds of yesterday
       Gm        Bb          C
And a dandelion dies in the wind

Am                          G
I see my eyes and I see my arms
D                        Am
The seagulls say you've gone
F                               C
It was just a game of let's pretend
Bb                    C                 F  F7
And I whistle to the waves that lend me tears

 F              Dm                         A
Purple clouds, golden rain, yesterday has gone
       Gm        Bb          C
And a dandelion dies in the wind
       Gm        Bb          C
And a dandelion dies in the wind
       Gm        Bb          C    D
And a dandelion dies in the wind...
