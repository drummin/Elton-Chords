    A                                   E
The roses in the window box have tilted to one side.
A/C#         D                           Bm             B
Everything about this house was born to grow and die.
        A                   F#m           | Bm     /C# | D |
Oh, it doesn't seem a year ago to this very day.
          A                 E                           D
You said "Sorry honey, if I don't change the pace, - I can't face another day."


CHORUS:
F#m            Bm           | E     Bm7   E | E  Bm7  E |
And love lies bleeding in my hand.
      F#m                  Bm             | E     Bm7   E | E  Bm7  E |
Oh it kills me to think of you with another man.
       A                                 Bm7
I was playing rock and roll and you were just a fan.
       A/C#                          D              | Am  /D  /A /F# |
But my guitar couldn't hold you so I split the band.
Fm#        E              A         {Replay Section E twice}
Love lies bleeding in my hands.


   A                                   E
I wonder if those changes have left a scar on you.
     A/C#             D                         Bm                 B
Like all the burning hoops of fire that you and I passed through.
         A                       F#m                     | Bm     /C# | D |
You're a bluebird on a telegraph line, I hope you're happy now.
        A                    E                           D
If the wind of change comes down your way girl - you'll make it back somehow.
