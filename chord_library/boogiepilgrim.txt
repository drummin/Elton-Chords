A D\A A  A7 A7 D\A

A     D\A    A
Crime in the streets

A D\A  A            A7   D\A    A     D\A A  A7 A7 D\A 
I read about it everyday in the papers

A	D\A       A            D\A 
Justice needs and justice wants

A   D\A     A      A7 A7 D\A A        D\A A  A7 A7 D\A  A D\A A  A7 A7 D\A 
But just in times, yes, too  late here

Bm	   A\C#     D
Feels like I wasn't born there

       D	          A       D\A A  A7 A7 D\A  A D\A A  A7 A7 D\A 
I feel just like a Boogie Pilgrim


A     D\A A    A7 A7 D\A 
Boogie Pilgrim

A       D\A    A  A7 A7 D\A 
Hustled to get it

A         D\A A   A7 A7 D\A 
To get it together

A       D\A      A   A7 A7 D\A 
Down on the jive talk

A           D\A A   A7 A7 D\A 
Down on the weather

Bm
Boogie Pilgrim

D		     A      D\A A  A7 A7 D\A 
Brother I never felt better

		 A      D\A A  A7 A7 D\A 
No, I never felt better


A   D\A    A        A7 A7 D\A 
Low life's complete

A           D\A   A        A7  A7 D\A A
When you've lived that way out on the sidewalk

D\A      A          A7   A7 D\A   A D\A A  A7 A7 D\A 
(Walking on the sidewalk everyday)

A         D\A   A              A7 A7 D\A 
I got the speed if you got the need

A       D\A     A  A7 A7 D\A 
But the need in me needs nothing

A        D\A  A      A7   A7 D\A 
(But you know that I need nothing)

Bm			         A\C#
But I know that you all want something

D			A D\A A  A7 A7 D\A  A D\A A  A7 A7 D\A 
Just like Boogie Pilgrim

(CHORUS)

(INSTRUMENTAL VERSE)

Bm	     A\C#   D
Boo, Boogie, Boogie Pilgrim

		   A     D\A A  A7 A7 D\A  A D\A A  A7 A7 D\A 
Lord, I never felt better.

(CHORUS)

(CHORUS, REPEAT, FADEOUT)
