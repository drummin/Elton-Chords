We All Fall In Love Sometimes
Elton John/Bernie Taupin

intro:
Gm  Am7b  D7

Gm
Wise men say
Am7b5
It looks like rain today
D7sus              D7
It crackled on the speakers
Gm                    Bb6           Eb
And trickled down the sleepy subway trains
Cm                   D7
For heavy eyes could hardly hold us
Gm                 Bb6 
Aching legs that often told us
Eb
It's all worth it
D7sus          D7       Gm
We all fall in love sometimes


The full moon's bright
And starlight filled the evening
We wrote it and I played it
Something happened it's so strange this feeling
Naive notions that were childish
Simple tunes that tried to hide it
But when it comes
We all fall in love sometimes


G                  D7        G
Did we, didn't we, should we couldn't we
C                       E7             Am
I'm not sure `cause sometimes we're so blind
Am/G                   D7
Struggling through the day
                           C    G  C  G
When even your best friend says
D7        C     A7
Don't you find
D7                      Gm
We all fall in love sometimes

break:
Gm  Am7b5  D7  Gm  Bb/F  Eb  
Cm  D7  Gm  Bb/F  Eb  D7sus  D  D7

    D7      G    C
And only passing time
      E7               Am 
Could kill the boredom we acquired
Am/G                    D7
Running with the losers for a while
                                  C    G   C  G
But our Empty Sky was filled with laughter
B7          B+  C       A7
Just before the flood
D7                            Gm
Painting worried faces with a smile
