Dmsus4

	       Gm
They must have loved each other once

	     Eb
But that was many years ago

	   Cm7
And by the time I came along

	      Cm6\D
Things were already going wrong

           Gm
I felt the pain in their pretence

	      Eb
The side they tried hard not to show

		Cm7
But through the simple eyes of youth

	  Cm6\D			D7
It wasn't hard to see the truth


Gm	 	      Eb
And in the end nobody wins

	    Cm7
When love begins to fall apart

    Bb\D     Eb
And it's the innocent who pay

	    Bb                    Eb\Bb
When broken dreams get in the way

Bb		     Am7            D  C\E  D\F#  Gm
The game begins, the game nobody wins


	       Gm
They must have loved each other once

	   Eb
Before the magic slipped away

	     Cm7
And as their life became a lie

	    Cm6\D
What love remained began to die

	  Gm
I used to hide beneath the sheets

	      Eb
I prayed that time would find a way

	     Cm7
But with the passing of the years

	     Cm6\D		      D7
I watched as laughter turned to tears

(CHORUS)

	   Gm
We used to love each other once

	     Eb
With all the passion we possessed

	   Cm7
But people change as time goes by

	      Cm6\D
Some feelings grow while others die

	  Gm
But if we learn from what we see

	     Eb
And face the truth while we still can

		Cm7
Then though the passion may be gone

	     Cm6\D		   D7
Some kind of love can still live on

(CHORUS)

Gm  A7\G  Am7-5\G  Adim7\G
		          Nobody Wins.
