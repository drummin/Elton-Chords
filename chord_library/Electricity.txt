Electricity
(From Billy Elliot)

Intro: F#m C#m/E D A/C# Fmaj7/D E E7


  A                          A/G
I can't really explain it, I haven't got the words

       A/F#                      B      
It's a feeling that you can't control

  Bm                            F#m
I suppose it's like forgetting, losing who you are

           Dm                            E 
And at the same time something makes you whole


Bridge:

     Am                  G      F               C    
It's like that there's a music, playing in your ear

        Am                 G              F           E7   
And I'm listening, and I'm listening, and then I disappear

Chorus:

           C                     Am7
And then I feel a change, like a fire deep inside

Fmaj7/D            C/E           D9/F#         G  
Something bursting me wide open, impossible to hide

    C                    C/Bb 
And suddenly I'm flying, flying like a bird

           F/A         Fm7/Ab
Like Electricity, electricity

         C/G                 F,aj7/G  G   C 
Sparks inside of me, and I'm free,    I'm free

It's a bit like being angry; it's a bit like being scared
Confused and all mixed up and mad as hell
It's like when you've been crying
And you're empty and you're full
I don't know what it is, it's hard to tell

It's like that there's some music, playing in your ear
But the music is impossible, impossible to hear

Chorus:

           C                     Am7
And then I feel a change, like a fire deep inside

Fmaj7/D            C/E           D9/F#         G  
Something bursting me wide open, impossible to hide

    C                    C/Bb 
And suddenly I'm flying, flying like a bird

           F/A         Fm7/Ab
Like Electricity, electricity

         C/G                 F,aj7/G  G   Am 
Sparks inside of me, and I'm free,    I'm free


Coda:

    Fm/Ab          C/G 
Electricity sparks inside of me

        F maj7/G  G   F#m C#m/E D A/C# F maj7/D E     A (hold)
And I'm free,     I'm free     Oh--------------,  I'm free
