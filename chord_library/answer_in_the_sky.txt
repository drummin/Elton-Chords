Verse 1:                Bb     Ab/Bb  Bb
             Well, they say that it's a fact,
                       Eb/Bb
              If you watch the sky at night.
              Eb
              If you stare into the darkness,
                               Bb
              You might see celestial light,
                      F                 
              And, if your heart is empty,
                     Gm                      Eb
              And there's no hope inside,
                             Bb                           F         Eb             Bb
              There's a chance you'll find an answer in the sky.

Verse 2:                Bb                 
             Well, they say that it's a shame,
                               Eb/Bb
              If you have nothing to believe.
                      Eb                 
              And, if you can't hold onto something,
                                  Bb             Ab/Bb   Bb
              You might as well die where you sleep.
                                         F
              You don't need a prayer,
                                                        Gm        Eb
              And there's no price to ask why,
                            Bb                          F        Eb              Bb   Ab/Bb   Bb
              But, sometimes, you'll find an answer in the sky.


Chorus:                                Eb     Ab/Bb  Bb
             And it's all so much bigger than it seems.
                                  Bb              Ab/Bb   Bb
             And it all overwhelms us now and then.
                           Bm7/D                           Eb
             And I'm banking on a chance that we believe
                   C/E                                           Cm/D#   F
             That good can still control the hearts of men.
             Bb  Ab/Bb  Bb    Eb/Bb                Eb                  Bb  Ab/Bb  Bb
             Oh                      Oh                      Oh                 Oh

             F   Gm   Eb

                     Bb                          F        Eb             Bb     Ab/Bb   Bb
             Sometimes, you'll find an answer in the sky.

Verse 3:       Bb        Ab/Bb  Bb
             This life's a long old road
                                  Eb/Bb
             We shouldn't have to walk alone,
                    Eb
             But, if you find the right companion,
                                         Bb                 Ab/Bb   Bb
             You won't feel so worn out when you've grown.
                           F                                        Gm     Eb
             All life is precious, and every day's a prize.
                             Bb                          F         Eb      Bb
             And, sometimes, you'll find an answer in the sky.
                           F                                        Gm     Eb
             All life is precious, and every day's a prize.
                             Bb                          F         Eb           Bb   Ab/Bb  Eb/Bb
             And, sometimes, you'll find an answer in the sky.
                             Bb                          F         Eb           Bb   Ab/Bb  Eb/Bb
             And, sometimes, you'll find an answer in the sky.
                             Bb                           F          Eb     Bb
             Yeah, sometimes, you'll find an answer in the sky.
