(From Billy Elliot)

Intro: C  Am  Dm  G

        C
Can you hear it in the distance

        Am
Can you sense it far away

      Dm
Is it old Rudolph the reindeer

      G 
Is it Santa on his sleigh

     E
It's heading up to Easington

     Am
It's coming down the Tyne

        D  
Oh it's bloody Maggie Thatcher

A                           Dm
We all sing together in one breath

Fm
Merry Christmas Maggie Thatcher

C
We all celebrate today

            Ab       Bb add E      C        
'Cause it's one day closer to your death

They've come to raid your stockings
And to steal your Christmas pud
But don't be too downhearted
It's all for your own good
The economic infrastructure
Must be swept away
To make way for call centres
And lower rates of pay

[repeat chorus]

And they've brought their fascist boot boys
And they've brought the boys in blue
And the whole Trade Union Congress
Will be at the party too
And they'll all hold hands together
All standing in a line
'Cause they're privatising Santa
This merry Christmas time

[repeat chorus]


[repeat chorus]
    
      C                                          G 
Oh my darling, oh my darling, oh my darling Heseltine

         Dm               C
You're a tosser, you're a tosser

           F      G    C (See notes below) 
And you're just a Tory Swine
