5th Avenue

Eb
I stumbled down 5th Avenue
Gm
In the winter time, 1982
Ab	       Fm
No heavy coat, thin pair of shoes
	Eb			   Bb
In the rush hour crowd, on 5th Avenue

Eb
I thought I saw someone I knew
Gm
Turned out to be no one but you
Ab		    Fm
Something borrowed, something blue
	    Eb	       	      Bb
Ducked in a doorway on 5th Avenue

Eb
All my crimes come back to haunt me
Gm
Every building seems to judge
Cm
Standing tall and looking down
     Ab
Like fingers pointing from above
Fm	  G7   Fm         G7
On 5th Avenue, on 5th Avenue
Cm          Ab		Bb  Eb
The party's over on 5th Avenue

Fortune finds the chosen few
Fools just find someone like you
Build a bank, or you buy a zoo
Monkeys and money on 5th Avenue

Snow falls on 5th Avenue
Your old man is on the evening news
Hard to believe how far he flew
Down, all the way down to 5th Avenue

(repeat chorus)
