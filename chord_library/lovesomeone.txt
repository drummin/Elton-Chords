You can stop the world, steal the face from the moon
You can beat the clock, but before high noon
You gotta love someone
You gotta love someone


Eb             Bb
You've got one life with a reason
                           Eb      Ab/Eb
You need two hearts on one side
Cm              
When you stand alone and there's no one there
   F7               Bb    Ab Gm  Fm  Eb        Bb
To share the way it feels inside and baby


You can cheat the devil and slice a piece of the sun
Burn up the highway but before you run
You gotta love someone
You gotta love someone

You let someone share the heat
            Cm           
When you're on your own and there's no one there
   F7                Bb    Ab   Gm   Fm  Eb     Bb
To cool the flames beneath your feet and baby


You can win the fight, you can grab a piece of the sky
You can break the rules but before you try
You gotta love someone
You gotta love someone
