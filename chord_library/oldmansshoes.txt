Ab                Eb                       Db                Db Db Db Db Eb
I'm moving out of Tombstone, yeah with the sun behind my back

Ab                  Eb               Db          Db Db Db Db Db
I'm tired of people talking of things that I lack

Bbm                    Db                    Ab
Ever since a week ago, the day he passed away

          Ab              Eb  		Db                       Db Db Db Db Eb
I've been taking too much notice of the things they've had to say


Ab                      Eb             Db               Db Db Db Db Eb
And all they say is you ain't half the man he used to be

Ab                     Eb                 Db             Db Db Db Db Db
He had strength and he worked his life to feed his family

Bbm                                     Db     	       Ab   
So if that's the way it has to be, I'll say goodbye to you

    Ab              Eb             Db                     Db Db Db Db Eb
I'm not the guy, or so it seems to fill my old man's shoes



Ab                       Eb        Db                  Ab
Like I'm a wicked way of life, the kind that should be tamed

       Ab             Eb                 Db               Ab
They'd like to see me locked in jail and tied up in their chains

        Ab         Bbm       Db                      Ab 
Oh it's hard and I can't see what they want me to do Lord, Lord

     Ab                     Bbm           Db        Ab    
They seem to think I should step into the old man's shoes
