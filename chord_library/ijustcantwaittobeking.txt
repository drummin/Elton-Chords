D
Way behind the water hole, a little down the line -
    G                                                   D
the jungle and the plains and peaks are scheduled to be mine.
    D
I'm gonna be the ruler of most everything around.
         G                                              D
From the grandest of the mountains to the humble common ground.
   Em7                   G - G    A            G          A    A7    D
My reign will be a super awesome thing.  Oh, I just can't wait to be king.


D
I'm gonna be a noble king, unscrupulously fair.
  G                                         D
I only need a little time, perhaps a little hair.
    D
I'm gonna be the mane event like no king was before.
    G                                               D
I'm brushing up on looking down.  I'm working on my roar.
    Em7                 G     A             G          A    A7    D
The fauna and the flora gonna swing.  Oh, I just can't wait to be king.


CHORUS:        C/G   G                 /F#     Em
No one saying 'Do   this.'      No one saying 'Be there.'
               A                             G/D  D     G/D   D
No one saying 'Stop that.'    No one saying 'See here!'
Em           G          A   D/A - A          G       D/A  A7    D
Free to run around all day.          I'll be free to do   it my way.

D
The time has come as someone said to talk of many things.
     G                                               D
This may be true but I would rather stick to talking kings.
     D
It's easy to be royal if you're already leonine.
   G                                          D
It isn't just my right even my left will be divine.
    Em7                 G     A             G          A    A7    D
The monarchy is waiting to go zing.   Oh, I just can't wait to be king.

              G          A    A7    D  G/D//   D///   G///   G///F# Em///  ////
Repeat: Oh, I just can't wait to be king.        Oh - oh.      Oh - oh.
