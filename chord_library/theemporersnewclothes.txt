C			   C\E
We bet on our lives and we bet on the horses
	F
In that upstairs apartment
     C
On Orlando and 4th
	G		     Am           C\G
And the rent was due and the rent man was knocking
       F
Like a Chinese proverb
	C\G C\G  C\G G     F
We were al- ways searching

C			 C\E
Nightlife's a no-win but nobody noticed
       F
How we killed off the bottles
	C
Looking good on the surface
    G			    Am	      C\G
The dog days barked and the house cat got old
	F
We were Bonnie and Clyde
       C\G      G    C	    F\C C
In the emperor's new clothes

	Am
And the tears never came
	  G\B
They just stayed in our eyes
     F\C		    F\C  C            C  G\B
We refused to admit that we wore this disguise
      Am
Every inch of us growing
        Gm
Like Pinocchio's nose
      A+      A		   Dm C\E Dm\F C\G        C  F\C C
As we walked around in the em-per-or's new clothes

   C			       C\E
We flew by our wits and by the seat of our pants
       F
In the state of illusion
       C
In the nation of chance
	G		     Am		     C\G
And the repo was hauling the wreck we'd been driving
       F
As the dashboard Madonna
       C\G            G
Smiled back at us kindly

   C			    C\E
We cheated the system never batting an eyelid
       F
Seeing only the good
	    C
Through the holes in our shoes
	G			Am	  C\G
And our halos were rusty but we wore them proudly
	F
We were two little gods
       C\G      G    C      F\C C
In the emperor's new clothes
