He would recount the stories he had learned so well

Bb7				     Fm	  (Fm Bb Fm Fm Fm Bb Bb)*
Fourteen years is a long time in one cell

	 Fm				          (Fm Bb Fm Fm Fm Bb Bb)*
When the pipe is passed the opium does its rounds

Bb7					      Fm   (Fm Bb Fm Fm Fm Bb Bb)*
Papa Legba sitting pretty in a chicken little town

(Fm Bb Fm Fm Fm Bb Bb)*


    Fm					   (Fm Bb Fm Fm Fm Bb Bb)*
His textured skin, like leather in the sun

Bb7				     Fm	 (Fm Bb Fm Fm Fm Bb Bb)*
Fingers beating hard upon a native drum

   Fm						   (Fm Bb Fm Fm Fm Bb Bb)*
He picks his teeth with a splintered back rib bone

Bb7			              Fm  (Fm Bb Fm Fm Fm Bb Bb)*
Papa Legba bears his fangs and lays alone

(Fm Bb Fm Fm Fm Bb Bb)*

       Fm					(Fm Bb Fm Fm Fm Bb Bb)*
He was free to dance alone where the spirits run

    Bb					    Fm  (Fm Bb Fm Fm Fm Bb Bb)*
His almond eyes would twinkle on a hundred sons

        Fm				    (Fm Bb Fm Fm Fm Bb Bb)*
His champagne toast and white meat on a spit

Bb					     Fm  (Fm Bb Fm Fm Fm Bb Bb)*
Papa Legba's drunken with a smile upon his lips

(Fm Bb Fm Fm Fm Bb Bb)*
