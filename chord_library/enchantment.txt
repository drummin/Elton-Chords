Intro: F - Eb - F/D - Bb/G - Bb - C

F                                   Bb/C  C 
A few more days and we'll be home in glory
Bb/G                                C
Already they'll be getting out the flags
F                        Bb/C   C
With Memphis high motor dormitory
Eb              C           Bb/G   C
For me, I only see a lot of snags

F                              Bb/C     C 
The prospect above all I find distressful
Bb/G                                C
Is having to give up the soldier's life
F                          Bb/C    C
If anything I'm rather too successful
Bb/G                  Bb/C           Eb   F        
They made me hand my sword in for a wife

Bb                                      F/A
For just because I've triumphed as a slaver
Bb                                 F/A
Brought booty back to Egypt by the ton
Ab                                   Eb/G
Of this and every month, I'm now the flavor
Bb/G                                   Bb/C   C
And scheduled to do things I've never done

F                  Eb                     F/D
And why should I tell you this, a stranger I just met
        Cm                 F               Bb
A woman who in hours from now I'll certainly forget
F/A                        Am  
Anonymous and undemanding
A                   Dm
Enchantment passing through
                    Gm        Eb     C                 Bb/G   Bb/C        
My secrets and my confidence.....are safe enough with you

F                                   Bb/C   C 
My days out on the field are all but ended
Bb/G                                         C
They'll put me out to grass which means the throne
F                                    Bb/C   C
Bedecked and bejeweled alongside my intended
Eb              C           Bb/G   C    
I feel as though my heart is set in stone

F                            Bb/C  C 
But maybe I am being far too gloomy
Bb/G                                    C
Yes, maybe I'll make waves in pastures new
F                                Bb/C   C
Find government and politics come to me
Bb/G                           Bb/C    Eb   F        
As naturally as I now talk to you
