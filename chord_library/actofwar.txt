Gm
1. This ain't no battle honey, this ain't no fight.
2. Well, you'd better believe it boy - this house is your home.
3. Well I'm a man of convenience - I work a long hard day.
4. Well if that's your game then honey two can play.

Eb                                                     Dm7
1. How come you take it so hard when I stay out all    night?
2. I didn't build it up for you to live here on my     own.
3. After twelve long hours, ain't I got the right to   play?
4. I'm going on the town tonight and have some fun my  way.

Gm
1. If I take a drink, is that against the law?
2. And if you think it's easy to forget about me -
3. If living together is getting in the way 
4. Ain't no way baby this girl's gonna stay.

Eb                                                         Dm7    Gm 
{intro}
1.          And if I have a good time, do you call that an act of war?
2. you'd better think twice - you'd better believe it's an act of war.
                              3. Huh - then I call that an act of war.
                                4. I call it, I call it an act of war.


CHORUS:  Gm
  We're living on the front line you & me.  

Fighting on this battleground of misery.
F                                                                   Gm
Oh, go ahead, bring on your artillery and we'll make this an act of 
war.
Gm
Give it all you've got `cause I'm all dug in.

Keep the punches coming I can take them on the chin.
F                                                                 Gm 
{intro}
Winner takes all, let the best man win - and we call it an act of war.



Eb                       F  
And it looks like time   -   ain't been on our side.
Cm                              Dsus               D               Gm
If we could turn the clock back   -   we might survive this act of war.
