            G                             G/B   G7
Now it was just like Frankie and Johnny.
            C                 G      G/D
And it was just like Stagger Lee.
G     G/D            G          G/D        C           G    G/D
Dolly Summers was a simple girl  - from a mid-west family.
       G                   G/F                C/E               G/D
With a stucco home and her own Mustang and a charge account at Sears.
        G/D                C
She had everything that a girl could want -
                           G/B          A     {replay intro}
     to live happy for the rest of her years.


         G             G/D     G      G7
But the thing that she wanted most of all -
              C                  G      G/D
     was the thing that she had lost.
       G                             G7             C            G  G/D
To the arms of a downtown black jack hustler by the name of Candyfloss.
G                        G/F              C/E              G
They'd skipped town on a late night train heading for the West.
G/D                       C
Dolly slipped behind the wheel of her Mustang -
             C      Em/B       A        A/E
     with a piece between her breast.



CHORUS:   F/D           Am       D7
She put a pistol in her shoulder holster. 
              F          F/C         F
She took her car up from Santa Fe.
C         C/G              C
Yesterday morning she was washing dishes,
                G             G/D       G
     now she's hunting down a runaway.
              F/D      Am   D7
Don't judge a man by a misdemeanor.
            F              F/C        F
You may be sorry when his light goes out.
                C             C/G       C
Don't put that pistol in your shoulder holster.
            G            Gm/Bb              Am       D7  {replay intro}
Oh, you can never, never tell if The Law's about.




      G                  G/B   G7       C             G      G/D
If it seemed just like a movie  -  or a night of bad TV,
            G     G/D        G       G/D         C                G G/D
   Shouldda had a picture of Dolly's face as she drove across country
     G                     G/F            C/E                 G/D
With daggers drawn for her fallen man and venom in her heart.
        G/D                 C                              G/B    A 
It was nearly dawn when she caught them up making out in a picnic park.




        G          G/D       G     G7       C               G      G/D
But the thing that shook her rigid - as she fumbled for her gun.
         G                                  G7
Was the state of the man that she'd married once 
         C                       G     G/D
     and thought of as the only one.
           G                  G/F          C/E                     G
And as she looked back on the chances that she'd passed up at home -
         G/D                C                       C      Em/B  A  A/E
Well she quietly dumped her pistol in a ditch & she headed home alone.


{Repeat Chorus}

Chords:          C  F/C  C          G       G/B C     G/B   
               You can never, never tell if the law's about.
(Repeat, Fade)
