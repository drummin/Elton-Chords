             Johnny B. Goode



He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack.
Sat beneath the tree by the railroad track.
An engineer could see him sitting in the shade -
     strumming with the rhythm that the drivers made.
The People passing by, they would stop and say
   "Oh my!  How that little country boy could play!"


{Repeat Chorus}


His mother told him, someday you will be a man.
You will be the leader of a big old band.
Many people coming from miles around -
     to hear you play your music when the sun goes down.
And maybe someday your name will be in lights - 
     saying Johnny B. Goode tonight.


{Repeat Chorus}
