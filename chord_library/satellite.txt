E
Well you come on like a comet, ideas in your head -
A/C#
     starving for affection, waiting to be fed.
E
Crazy like a full moon, eyes open wide -
A/C#
     taking in everything you need to stay alive.



           E               Bm7/E          A
Who leads who?   Who knows when?  If you leave me now will I see you 
again.



                 E                  B/D#
I'm telling you love bites - like a satellite. 
      A/C#                 A/B                             E
Going round and round it's something, something you can't fight.
           B/D#                      A/C#                        A/B
Oh, in the daylight annd even in the dark night I want you to surround 
me -
                         E    {play intro}
     surround me like a satellite.


E
Oh, you move like a shadow of your own design.
A/C#
Do you want to trap me in between the lines?
E
I don't walk on water if you think I can.  
A/C#
If you want a miracle call up a Superman.



E             D6             C6                       A
Are we there?   Is this love?   Is this a space race that we're both 
part of?
