C  C  C  C  Bb  F  (REPEAT ABOUT 4x)

Am
Sometimes I think I'm going crazy

Dm
Staring at the same four walls

C               G\B             F
Waiting for the working day to end

Am
Then I get home so wasted, worn out

Dm
I curse at you and tell you

C                         G\B            F
How I've done the work of ten to fifteen men

         F7 
How I've struggled for my money

F7                      Am
Sweated blood to get us by, yeah

         F7
Well I'm tired of it honey

F7                      Dm       	 E
Think I'm gonna have to leave here for a while


Cm					   F
Oo-ee-oo-ee-oo, All you hear are hard luck stories

Cm                  		           F
Oo-ee-oo-ee-oo, And the ways I look at life

Cm					      F        D7
Oo-ee-oo-ee-oo, And the way I think the world treats me

Cm		    	G\B		    F
Oo-ee-oo-ee-oo, And the way that I treat my wife

C  Bb F  C  Bb F

Am          
I never seem to look at you

    Dm 
And see that somewhere underneath

  C             G\B             F
A pair of tired eyes are crying out

         Am  
Well you know I work hard all day long

Dm  
Let me kiss you once with meaning

C       G\B               F
Just to kill this nagging doubt

         F7
Well you don't deny I do you proud

        Am
And you expect me to be tired

    F7
You say there's no future in our lives

D\F#                                E
While I persist I'm putting out the fire


Cm 					   F
Oo-ee-oo-ee-oo, All you hear are hard luck stories

Cm					    F
Oo-ee-oo-ee-oo, Just a few well chosen words

Cm						   F          D7\F#
Oo-ee-oo-ee-oo, `Cause you're still the woman of a working man

Cm     			       G\B                 F
Oo-ee-oo-ee-oo, You've got the heart of a working girl
