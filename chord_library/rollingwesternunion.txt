I've served upon this railroad for longer than I know

   Bbm		  Ebm    Db      Cb                 Db         
My father and his father did the same thing long ago

   Gb				  Cb
To keep the Western Union rolling down towards the sea

    Bbm		Ebm	   Db   Cb                  Gb
The benefits of this great line built for you and me


   Bbm		   Db             Cb      	    Gb
So Rolling Western Union, you can roll on to the sea

    Bbm	              Ebm     Db	       Cb           Db
Ten thousand miles of beatin' steel has made a man out of me

   Bbm		    Db		  Cb
In every state I've driven home a rivet with my hands

        Gb      Db\F    Ebm7	              			     Gb
Oh it's Rolling Western Union rolling onward, onward through our land


     Gb				       Cb
It's friends of mine who died upon the building of this line

Bbm	     Ebm  Db	  Cb			     Db
Irishmen and Chinamen and some from the British Isles

     Gb			            Cb
I've even seen the convicts come to work here for a while

  Bbm		      Ebm     Db       Cb                Gb
Before the law caught up with them and sent them back to trial

(CHORUS)

  Gb			        A
I had a wife while on the job a hundred miles on back

    Cb			   Gb
She died in Oklahoma and I laid her by the track

Gb				  A
All that's left is a wooden cross upright on a mound

    Cb						       Cb
And every time the train rolls past, it rumbles in the ground

(CHORUS)

        Gb      Db\F    Ebm7	              			     Gb
Oh it's Rolling Western Union rolling onward, onward through our land
