"When The First Tear Shows"
Music By: Elton John
Lyrics By: Bernie Taupin
Unreleased 1968


C                      Bb/C   F/C         C       C9
Hold my hand girl much tighter, much much tighter
       Em               Am    Em            Am
'Cause what I've got to say I only hope and pray
      F              F/E Dm    Dm/C       G      G7
Comes out as well as I rehearsed it yesterday

                  C     Em/B  A     C/G
And baby when the first tear shows
       D/F#     D      F
It's a sign for you to go
G7                C     Em/B Am     C/G
And baby when the first tear shows
       D/F#                   F
It's a sign for you to go and leave her alone
                C/G             G
With the broken dreams that she owns

       C
It's a crime for me to tell you
       F/C           C           C9
It's a sin for me to stay
         Em            Am
And I'll never look behind me
       Em             Am
When I start to walk away
         C              F/E      Dm    G
Girl I'm sorry but it's all that I can say

(to chorus)

    F/C                      C
You know that I used to love you so
   F/C                 C
Enjoy every moment together
     G7
Well I'm not the kind of man
      C
To forever hold your hand
         F               Dm7      G
And I've said as much as I should say

(repeat chorus and fade)
