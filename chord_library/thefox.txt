      Db		Ab
Being wiry and thinking loudly

	  Gb	 Gb\Ab   Gb\Ab    Db   Gb\Db Db
About the things sent to make you move

	  Db		 	     Ab   
You can't help it, there's no one in this world

          Gb    Gb\Ab    Gb\Ab   Db  Gb\Db Db
Knows you just, just the way you do

   Fm\C    Bbm     Db\Ab       Gb
So we keep darting through the holes

       Db	       Ab
As the hunter and the fox

        Gb         Gb\Ab Gb\Ab      Db  Gb\Db  Db
Run the gauntlet's sa_________vage road

   Fm\C    Bbm     Db\Ab       Gb
So we keep darting through the holes

       Db	       Ab
As the hunter and the fox

        Gb         Gb\Ab Gb\Ab      Db  Gb\Db  Db
Run the gauntlet's sa_________vage road


 	 Db               Ab
Winter's heavy and partly cloudy

		 Gb	    Gb\Ab       Gb\Ab   Db  Gb Db
And the snowfall leaves the tracks that catch a few

	      Db		 	 Ab  
But if you're wiley, you will leave them lying

          Gb	       Gb\Ab     Gb\Ab    Db  Gb Db
Snared up in the traps that they set for you

    Fm      Bbm Db      Gb
And it's an evergreen affair

       Db	 	  Ab
As temptation taunts the fox

         Gb            Gb\Ab    Gb\Ab   Db   Gb\Db Db
Into the hunter's, the hunter's waiting lair

    Fm      Bbm Db      Gb
And it's an evergreen affair

       Db	 	  Ab
As temptation taunts the fox

         Gb            Gb\Ab    Gb\Ab   Db   Gb\Db Db
Into the hunter's, the hunter's waiting lair


        Bbm        Bbm		     Ebm     Ebm
And for mile after mile you'll never see me tire

       Db		       Ab
You'll never see me slow down, for a while

       Bbm Db\Ab  Gb		  Db
`Cause I   am the fox, like it or not

    Bbm		 Bbm		  Ebm      Ebm
I'm always gonna be there running over the rock

Db		  Ab
Yes I am the fox, a fascinating cross

   Bbm   Db\Ab Gb		    Db
Of sharp as a  whip and tough as an ox

Ab   	     Gb  Gb\Ab Gb\Ab  Gb\Ab Gb\Ab  Db
Yes I am the fox


	     Db     		  Ab
It may sound crazy but it's often lonely

 	Gb			 Gb\Ab    Gb\Ab       Db  Db2 Db
And the restless heart should be captured once in a while

             Db			     Ab
Then you can use them, and you often fool them

	Gb	   Gb\Ab Gb\Ab  Db  Gb Db
Into believing whatever  you desire

   Fm        Bbm    Db\Ab        Gb
So I'll keep moving through the night

    Db		    Ab
The hunter and the hunted

         Gb           Gb\Ab Gb\Ab   Db    Gb Db
On their desig, their desig-nated flights

   Fm        Bbm    Db\Ab        Gb
So I'll keep moving through the night

    Db		    Ab
The hunter and the hunted

         Gb           Gb\Ab Gb\Ab   Db    Gb Db
On their desig, their desig-nated flights

(CHORUS)

   Fm        Bbm    Db\Ab        Gb
So I'll keep moving through the night

    Db		    Ab
The hunter and the hunted

         Gb           Gb\Ab Gb\Ab   Db    Gb Db
On their desig, their desig-nated flights

(REPEAT, FADE)
