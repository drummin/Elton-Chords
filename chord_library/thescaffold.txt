F#                            G#
In Orient where wise I was to please the way I live.
     G#m7                                              F#
Come give the beggar chance at hand his life is on his lip.
                                   G#
Three score a thousand times where once in Amazon. 
      G#m7                                       F#
Where El Dorado holds the key no keeper holds my hand.



CHORUS:
  Bbm7              Ebm                          F#/C#
Unchain the gate of solitude, the ruler says you run.
                  Ab/C           D7               F#/C#              C#
Run hard unto the scaffold high  -  your chance to  -  jump the gun.
F#                                    C#7                F#
Oh, how high the scaffold grows - the plant life of your widow.
                                             C#7                 F#
In black lace curtains brought you near from out the plate glass window.
F#                                    C#7                F#
Oh, how high the scaffold grows - the plant life of your widow.
                                             C#7                 F#
In black lace curtains brought you near from out the plate glass window.



F#                                 G#
The Minotaur with bloody hands is  -  enraged by the sun.
G#m7                                         F#
Caged he by the corpses brought forth by the dawn.
                            G#
In Orient is as I told the buckshee hangman swears.
    G#m7                                          F#
For open crypts to silence nylon knots to sway by prayer.


{Repeat Chorus}



F#                            G#
In Orient where wise I was to please the way I live.
     G#m7                                                F#
Come give the beggar chance at hand - his life is on his lip.
