Db  Ab  Eb  Db  Ab

    Eb 
I'm stoned in the twilight
Ab\Eb
Screaming on the inside
Gb\Db	     Db		       Ab
Give me your water, help me survive
Eb
Gonna miss the sunlight
Ab\Eb
When I lose my eyesight
Gb\Db	   Db			Ab    Eb
Give me my red shoes, I want to dance
Db		   
They search for an answer
	 Ab\C
But that old man wouldn't listen
     Cm7
Back then I was handsome
     Bb\F
Back then he was ignorant

    Eb				  Ab\Eb
And shave off the years now, it's all inside my head
    Db	       Ab	    Eb		  Bb\F
The boy in the red shoes is dancing by my bed
Eb			    Ab\Eb
Put them in a box somehere, put them in a drawer
Db	Ab		   Eb		Db  Ab\C  Eb   Db  Ab  
Take my red shoes, I can't wear them anymo__________re

Had garlands in the wings back then
All the pretty little things back then
Calling out my name, oh what fame brings
After curtain calls and bows
I can't see the front row now
Hand me my red shoes just one more time

They pushed aside our presence
They refused to go the distance
Back then I was Sigmund
Back then he wouldn't listen

(CHORUS)

(INSTRUMENTAL VERSE)

     Db		      
They pushed aside our presence
       Ab\C
They refused to go the distance
     Cm7
Back then I was Sigmund
     Bb\F
Back then he wouldn't listen
     Cm7
Back then I was handsome
     Bb\F
Back then he was ignorant

    Eb				  Ab\Eb
And shave off the years now, it's all inside my head
    Db	       Ab	    Eb		  Bb\F
The boy in the red shoes is dancing by my bed
Eb			    Ab\Eb
Put them in a box somehere, put them in a drawer
Db	Ab\C	  	   Eb	        Db
Take my red shoes, I can't wear them anymore.

Put them in a box somehere, put them in a drawer
