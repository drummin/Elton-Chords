This chord sheet provides basic interpretations of the chords featured in 
sheet music and on the GOODBYE YELLOW BRICK ROAD album.  Sir Elton, over the 
years, has adapted and changed this song many times in concert, often adding
several minutes in length.  He has added classical, early rock and other songs
into the outtro.  Many excellent versions are available, including the solo 1979
version which had parts of it included on the video TO RUSSIA... WITH ELTON, and the 
lengthy 1984 version from the BREAKING HEARTS TOUR video.  See these and other numerous
recordings available, and use what you feel works best for you.  Be creative with this song,
as with all songs which you find off of chord sheets and TABs.  This one leaves a lot open to 
interpretation.  Have fun with it.

                  G#dim
     that's been known to change the weather.

We'll kill the fatted calf tonight so stick around.

Say, Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet?

Hey kids, plug into the faithless.

Maybe they're blinded but Bennie makes them ageless.
Am7          D                           Em
We shall survive, let us take ourselves along.

Where we fight our parents out in the streets to find who's right & who's wrong.
