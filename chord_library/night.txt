intro:
F   C/E   Dm   Bb(add9)

F                     C/E
In the nicotine glare of a cold naked light
Dm                             Bb
I drag my body from the covers and down forty flights
F                                 C/E
I run out the front door into the center of the street
Dm                                       Bb
I scream out your name as the steam just swells around my feet
F                         C/E
I hear you after midnight from the inner city
Dm                           Bb
As every Cinderella turns to drop dead pretty
F                                 C/E
We were built out of the darkness into this West Side Story
Dm                                      Bb
We came together in the shadows but the moon just steals our glory

C
Well this is my battleground baby
D
This is my plaything
Bb
The only thing I've ever known
C
Outside of a wedding ring

            F           C/E   Dm
And I swear I heard the night talking
               Bb      F                    C
Cursing me for being a little more than hopeless
F                        C/E               Dm
Telling me we're running lonely, loose and broken
                Bb          F                 C
Stronger now on passion but haven't we really spoken
           Bb      C                      F          C/E   Dm   Bb   Bb(add9)
And all we ever do is listen to the night talking


On the burden of insanity we can't find the cause
On a flatbed truck well the home girl she paints her claws
There's a coward who gets his courage undercover of the dark
And it's a strange breed of devil freeze at night to go walking in the park (to chorus)
