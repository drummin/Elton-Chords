Intro: E  A/E  D/E  A/E (repeat once)  
 
              E  
You can take her

                 A/E
Make her change her name

D/E
You and your old money

           A/E            
Dance around the flame

                   G      
But you can never,

A                          E      A/E
Never love her like me

               E
You can charm her

                A/E
Calm her when she’s wild

D/E
Show a little comfort

               A/E  
Play with her inner child

                   G
But you can never,

A                          E 
Never love her like me


Chorus:
               C#
So I just close my eyes

B                                     A
Steal her away when you sleep

Bm
Sneak her in my dreams every

G                        E
Single day of the week

               C#
You may have her in real world

       B                       A
But if you could only see

               Bm        A/C#          D        A   
How we rock this room in the twilight zone

                    G
And you can never,

A                           E
Never love her like me

A/E  D/E  E


You can warm her
Charm her with your style
I know you convinced her
She’s the love of your life
And no, you’ll never, never love her like me

You can bless her
Keep her conscience clean
You can undress her
Go all the places I’ve been
But you’ll never, never love her like me

Chorus:
               C#
So I just close my eyes

B                                     A
Steal her away when you sleep

Bm
Sneak her in my dreams every

G                        E
Single day of the week

               C#
You may have her in real world

       B                       A
But if you could only see

               Bm        A/C#          D        A   
How we rock this room in the twilight zone


First Time:
                    G
And you can never,

A                           E
Never love her like me

A/E  D/E  E (repeat Chorus)

Second Time:

                    G
And you can never,

A
Never

G/B
Never

A/C#
Never

G
Never

A                           E
Never love her like me
