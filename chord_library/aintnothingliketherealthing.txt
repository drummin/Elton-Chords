Ain't nothing like the real  thing,   ba-by.  Ain't nothing like the real thing.
Ain't nothing like the real  thing,   ba-by.  Ain't nothing like the real thing.



E9         E               F#m7  E/G#     A                 Absus   Ab
I got your picture hanging on my wall but it can't sing, or come to me -
            C#m                Bm7           Amaj7          A    E
     when I call your name.  I realized it's just a picture in a frame.
             E          F#m7       E/G#   A
I read your letters but you're not here.  They don't move me, 
Absus      Ab            C#m         Bm7              Amaj7      A     E
they don't prove it like when I hear your sweet voice whispering in my ear.



          E        F#m7   E/G#   A              Absus     Ab    C#m
I play my games of fan-ta-sy.    I've been down.  I don't see reality.
  Bm7              Amaj7           A       E
I need the shelter of your arms to comfort me
           E           F#m7     E/G#   A                  Absus        Ab
I got some memories to look back on,  though they help me when you're gone
    C#m        Bm7         Amaj7                 A     E
I'm well aware nothing can take the place of you being there.



         Abm   Ab/C                            C#m
No other sound   -   is quite the same as your name.
   E7/B                 Amaj7 E/B           C#m7         E/F#
No touch can do half as much  -  to make me feel better.
F#9      A/B          B             A/B      B   A/B   B   A/B   B
Let's stay together.     Ah, ah.    Ooh.



E     B/E              F#m/E  E    F#m/E E    Amaj7                  F#m7
Ain't nothing like the real  thing,   ba-by.  Ain't nothing like the real thing.
   So glad we  got the real  thing,   ba-by.     So glad we  got the real thing.
