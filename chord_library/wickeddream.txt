C           F                G
Its written clear across the room
Am        F                       G
In silent words the blind would understand
Am          F         G
I came here to relax find
               Cm               F    Am  G
The sleep that soaks me up like surf and sand

C         F           G
And you appear as I descend
Am         F                   G
A soft out line all poised and feather light
Am     F                 G              Em
I come into the darkness now to conjure up and dream and 
F     D7/F#  G7
close my     eyes

Am      F       G
Dont disturb me if you dare
Am         F   G
Join me if you have the nerve
    C        Am        F              G
Ill show you where the best of me has been
  Am      F        G
Behind my eyes Ill wait for you
Am      F         G
Imagine just what we could do
     C       Am      F    G      C
Come join me in my wicked dream

Dont send me back to real life
The daily grind just leaves me feeling numb
Leave me in my wicked dream where preassure cracks and beauty
comes undone
