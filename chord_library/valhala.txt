G 
The seadogs have all sailed their ships

F           C\E        G
Into the docks of dawn

               D\F#            Em
While the sirens sit and comb their hair

       C                      G
And twiddle with their thumbs



     Eb                   Bb
Oh Thor above the mountain

         Eb\Bb                F\A
Look down upon your children

F                Eb 
This is their heaven where they're told

                     Dm          G
To bring their galleons



G                          G\B 
Seek you find your place with me

Em 
Men of iron, men of steel

Eb 
Only the brave hear the hammers ring

          Eb                                                     D
In the courts of the Queens, in the halls of the Kings



            G       Am G\B C                          D
You can come to Val-hala in your own time

G       Am G\B C                               D G 
Come to Val-hala seek and you will find Val-hala

Am     Am\B     C    D 

G      Am G\B C                           D
Come to Val-hala in your own time

G       Am G\B                  C          D  G
Come to Val-hala seek and you will find Val-hala

Am   G\B   C   D 


G 
There's long boats in the harbour

              F           C\E    G
Which arrive there every hour

              D\F#          Em 
With the souls of the heroes

           C                      G
Whose blood lies on the flowers


             Eb                Bb
And this heaven is the home

             Eb\Bb                    F\A
Of every man who loves his sword

            F             Eb
And he uses it for freedom

     Eb                         Dm     G
To preach the word of Thor
