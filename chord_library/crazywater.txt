     F
On a bench, on the beach

       Eb               Bb\D
Just before the sun had gone

	    F
I tried to reach you

Cm		 D
Plain faced and falling fast

Gm			     Bb
You looked so vacant like an empty shell

G\B   F\C		       C
Whose life had passed upon the ocean  Mmmmm

Bb\C F\C  F     Bb\F  F     F
Be-  fore light shook the sky

     Eb           Eb Bb\D
Down by the docks I saw

	    F
The masts unfolding

Cm	    D		       Gm
Don't turn away, please understand

		  Bb
It's a life and a living

G\B   F\C	       
And a way to keep the wolves away

     C			
From hungry hands, from hungry hands


      Dm 
Crazy water

F			 F\G F\A  Bb      Eb\Bb Bb
Takes my fishing boat on Mon-day morning

	    F\A
Dangerous dreaming

      F				      F\G   F\A      Bb
If we all believe in the things you believe you're seeing

         F\A 		Bb 		  Gm7	  Gm7\A  Bb
Oh we'd never drop our nets in the crazy water, crazy   water

Bb\D F\D  F      Bb\F F  F
Tan- gled lives, lone-ly wives

Eb 
Shoreline widows pray

Eb	Bb\D               F
For the souls of missing whalers

Cm		     D
Endless nights on an endless sea

Gm		      Bb
Where nothing lives between us

G\B	 F		 F
Just the breakers on the ocean

	   C
Separating you and me

	   C
Separating you and me
