WHEN I WAS TEALBY ABBEY (John/Taupin)

     Ab          Eb
I'm very low but not too dim
       Eb7                   Ab
I can still see the faces of you and him
    Cm                 Fm
I remember well how it used to be
      Bb7        Eb           Ab
You remember too obviously, remember when

                      Db           Ab
Remember when, I was Tealby Abbey then
       Cm           Fm          Bb7              Eb
It was not so long ago, maybe a hundred years or so
            Gb    Db
When I was Tealby Abbey
          Ab
That's a long long time ago
            Gb    Db
When I was Tealby Abbey
          Ab
That's a long long time ago

                                Eb
When the clock stopped and the rocks dropped
         Eb7                   Ab
And the gravel started giving away
       Cm               Fm
I can still recall when we were small
    Bb7               Eb7
But oh what a fateful day

    Ab                  Eb
In younger times, the children climbed
Eb7               Ab
Up and down your walls
       Cm                   Fm
And a curse on the day the fates will say
      Bb7          Eb      Ab
When Tealby Abbey falls, remember when

                      Db           Ab
Remember when, I was Tealby Abbey then
       Cm           Fm          Bb7              Eb
It was not so long ago, maybe a hundred years or so
            Gb    Db
When I was Tealby Abbey
          Ab
That's a long long time ago
            Gb    Db
When I was Tealby Abbey
          Ab
That's a long long time ago

                      Db           Ab
Remember when, I was Tealby Abbey then
       Cm           Fm          Bb7              Eb
It was not so long ago, maybe a hundred years or so
            Gb    Db
When I was Tealby Abbey
          Ab
That's a long long time ago
            Gb    Db
When I was Tealby Abbey
          Ab
That's a long long time ago
