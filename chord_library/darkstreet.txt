repeat intro to 2nd verse

all the layoffs and the pay cuts
cripple me inside
i pay the price for living every day
trying to keep us all together
along with a little pride
what will it take to make you stay

but ive dreamed about an island
when all i gots a bucket of sand
id give me eyes to give you all your dreams
now i get to see my family slipping through my hands

outro:same as intro
