Eb Ab C# Ab G Cm Ab F# intro riff
Got a penny in my pocket and a dollar in my hand 
I'd drop it in your tin cup if you were a one man band
If I could make a million on some tv show or the roulette will in a great big casino

C# Ab Eb Bb G Cm Ab F# C# intro riff
Go ahead and do it 
Cause only if I knew
I could go ahead and claim it 
In the name of you
Whatever words I choose
Whatever tricks I use
I would find a way to claim it
In the name of you

Intro

Eb Ab C# Ab G Cm Ab F# intro riff
I've got my favorite hat 
With that snakeskin band
When you need a shake
I'll put it in your hands
To the bottom of the ocean
I would surely die
To find the oldest oyster 
With the biggest pearl inside

All the undiscovered Territory
Out there beyond the moon
