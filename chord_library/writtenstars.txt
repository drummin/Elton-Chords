by: Elton John and Tim Rice

Intro: C - G/C - F/C

C           G/C  F/C         C          E/Ab
I'm here to tell you we can never meet again
Am              C/G         F                Gsus4  G
Simple really, isn't it, a word or two and then
C                 G/C  F/C  C                    E/Ab
A lifetime of not knowing where or how or why or when
Am                  C/G             F         	
You think of me or speak of me or wonder what befell
      Dm						Gsus4  G
The someone you once loved so long ago so well

C             G/C   F/C      C              E/Ab
Never wonder what I feel as living shuffles by
Am                  C/G      F           Gsus4  G
You don't have to ask me and I need not reply
C             G/C  F/C        C          E/Ab
Every moment of my life from now until I die
Am               C/G              F         	
I will think or dream of you and fail to understand
      Dm		           		   Gsus4  G
How a perfect love can be confound and out of hand

C                   
Is it written in the stars
         Am       
Are we paying for some crime
        F            
Is that all that we are good for
        Gsus4             G 
Just a stretch of mortal time

C     
Is this God's experiment
    Am   
In which we have no say
     F     
In which we're given paradise
     Gsus4      G 
But only for a day

C                G/C F/C          C          E/Ab
Nothing can they alter, there is nothing to decide
Am              C/G             F             Gsus4  G
No escape, no change of heart, no anyplace to hide
C                 G/C  F/C        C        E/Ab
You are all I'll ever want, but this I am denied
Am               C/G              F         
Sometimes in my darkest thoughts, I wish I'd never learn
        Dm		           		   Gsus4        G  
What it is to be in love and have that love returned
