       D7         /      /      / G7                 /B       /D
I got frostbitten in the winter - ice skating on the river.
        E7            /           /      /G#
With my pretty little black-eyed girl.
                A         /            G7       /
She'd make your darn toes curl just to see her there.



BRIDGE:  D7          /     /      /F#
I got a fringe front on my buggy.
        G7             /        /      /
I got a frisky little colt in a hurry
      E7             /         A7           G7    D   /C  /B  /A
And a pretty little black-eyed Suzie by my, by my side.



CHORUS:  D-D-Em-Db/F - D/F#   D-D-Em/Db/F - D/F#
Well she sure knows    how to use me -
G - G - F/A - F#/A#  G/B         G - G - F/A - F#/A#  G/B
pretty little        black-eyed Suzie.
A7                 G7       /B       D7 /C /B /A
Playing hooky with my heart all the time.
D-D-Em-Db/F  -  D/F#   D-D-Em/Db/F - D/F#
Living with her funky  family -
     G - G - F/A - F#/A#   G/B       G - G - F/A - F#/A#  G/B
in a der    -    e    -    lict old alley.
E7                         A7             G7            F   C - D
Down by the river where we share a little loving in the moonshine.



       D7      /        /      /         G7         /      /B    /D
I'm an old hayseed harp player.  I'm the hit of the county fair.
         E7           /           /     /G#
With my pretty little black-eyed girl
        A            /             G7        /
Living proof as she swirls she's a dancer - yeah.
