            Bm                A                G
I've seen a lot of women who haven't had much luck.
               D                        A             C
I've seen you looking like you've been run down by a truck.
            Bm              A                        G
That ain't nice to say sometimes I guess I'm really hard.
         D                   A                     C                  D {Intro}
But I'm gonna put a buckshot in your pants if you step into my yard.



       Bm                    A               G
When I watch the police come by and move you on -
        D                        A                        C
Well I sometimes wonder what's beneath the mess you've become.
         Bm                  A                    G
Well you may have been a pioneer in the trade of women's wear.
     D                 A                  C                        D
But all you got was a mop up job washing other people's stairs.


           G        /B             /D    /B      D
I'm gonna tell the world, you're a dirty little girl.
Em                 C            D
Someone grab that bitch by the ears.
Bm              A                 G
Rub her down.  Scrub her back.   Turn her inside out.
       D         A7         Em             Bm       A7                  D{Intro}
Cuz I bet she, I bet she, I bet she - oh I bet she hasn't had a bath in years.


          Bm               A              G
Here's my own belief about all the dirty girls
          D                A                   C
that you have to clean the oyster to find the pearl.
         Bm                   A                G
And like rags that belong to you I belong to myself.
    D                    A                     C                   D
So don't show up around here till your social worker's helped.
 

{Repeat Chorus}

Bm  A  G
       Oh.

Bm  A  G
       Oh!

(CHORUS)

	     Bm
Dirty little girl.

D						       Bm
Dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty little girl.
(REPEAT, AD LIB, FADE)
