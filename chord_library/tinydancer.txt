Blue jean baby, L.A. lady, seamstress for the band

C      F\C  C         F\C C                      Am  G
Pretty eyed, pirate smile, you'll marry a music man

F     C\E Am		  D7	 F C\E		      Am  Bdim\G
Ballerina, you must have seen her  dancing in the sand

C             F\C   C       F\C      C    F\C           C   Bdim\F  C\E  Dm
And now she's in me, always with me, tiny dancer in my hand

C     F\C   C           F\C  
Jesus freaks out in the street

C       F\C  		 Am  G\B
Handing tickets out for God

C       F\C C         F\C  
Turning back she just laughs

C        F\C  		   Am  G
The boulevard is not that bad


F     C\E Am     	 D7
Piano man   he makes his stand

F      C\E       Am  Bdim\G
In the auditorium

C       F\C C              F\C  
Looking on   she sings the songs

C               F\C   		   G  Bdim\F  C\E  Dm  
The words she knows, the tune she hums

C  F\C  C  F\C  

Ab	        Bb
But oh how it feels so real

Gm		Cm     Cm\Bb
Lying here with no one near

Ab		     Bb
Only you and you can hear me

	   Bdim	     Dm
When I say softly, slowly


F	C\E	      Dm   C\E 
Hold me closer tiny dancer

F	   C\E               G
Count the headlights on the highway

F	C\E	          Dm   C\E
Lay me down in sheets of linen

F	  C\E	   G
you had a busy day today


F	C\E	      Dm   C\E 
Hold me closer tiny dancer

F	   C\E               G
Count the headlights on the highway

Lay me down in sheets of linen
