The New Fever Waltz

3/4 Time

|   Bm   |   G   |   D   |   A   |
|   Bm   |   G   |   D   |   A   |

   Bm          A/C#     D
Forgotten scars      remind us of
G           A/C#     Bm
Too much war,    too little love
  G                    D/F# 
Beneath the fault line truth to burn
    F              C/E
Within the page so much to learn
Bm           A/C#   D
Wounded birds       look to us
G           A/C#    Bm
Who can heal,       who to trust
      G               D/F#
Bring down the giants old and new
       F               C/E      G       C/D   G
Strike up the band and waltz on through

chorus:
      D              F#m
I was shaking with a fever
         Bm                       Bm/A
When the last good horse went down
        G                D
We were just a couple dancing
        A              D/A          Bm  A/C#
Where a thousand kings were crowned
D              F#m
Shaking with a fever
Bm                    Bm/A
Before the white flag flew
        G               D/F#
And the ballroom opened up to us
        F       G         D
And the dancers danced on through

repeat intro 

Bm       A/C#    D
Love in ru  ins, torn apart
G        A/C#     Bm
Victims of    the careless heart
G              D/F#
Skating on the cold grey ice
   F               C/E
Before the flood toward the light
Bm         A/C#      D
Muddy boots      to shiny shoes
G               A/C#   Bm
Headlines screaming    out the news
     G                D/F#
From dirt and camp to hardwood floors
  F                   C/E    G
Beyond the burned out broken walls

repeat chorus
