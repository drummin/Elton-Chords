Verse 1: F                 Dm         Gm7-5/A       A  
             We are still alright. We took it on the chin,
                  F#aug/D            D       Bb            Bb/C   C 
             But in the thirteenth hour, no one ever wins, but
             F                    Dm            Gm7-5/A       A
             We are strong enough, like traffic all tied up,
                  F#aug/D             D              Bb           Bb/D  C
             And when the static clears,   the radios still buzz, and I


Chorus: Db/Ab        Ab                        Ab/Eb   Eb
             I stop and I breathe 'cause you wanted me,
             Db/Bb          Ab            F#
            And I wanted you so bad.
             Eb                     Bb                     Bb     F
            And, I stop and I breathe 'cause I still believe.
                       G/B                        Ab  Eb       Bb   Bb/C   C
            No one really knows what it is that we have.


Verse 2: F                    Dm      Gm7-5/A            A
             Like blood in a vein, we chased this one down,
                    F#aug/D         D                   Bb             Bb/C
             And, in the darkest long night, we turned it all around, 
                   C       F                Dm        Gm7-5/A      A
             And it was, cold dusty snow that covered the fields,
                       F#aug/D      D                  Bb     Bb/C   C
             But the corn, it still grew, and the injury healed, and I
