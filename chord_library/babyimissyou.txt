Time goes by, it seems so long
G7               C       Em/B  Am          C/G    D
But it was only days ago when things were going wrong
      D7              G    B7              Em  G/D
What happened to the love, to the love we knew....
C             G             D7           G  D7  G
The days we shared were so short and so few......

     G7     C      D7        G   B7  Em
And baby I miss you, baby I miss you...
  G7              C
Remember when it didn't rain
D7                   G
Will I ever see the sun again
G7          C       D7       G   B7  Em
And baby I miss you, baby I miss you...
G7    C                       D7               G  D7
And I only wish that I could share your love again..

    G                  B7             Em
I thought about leaving for some new place
G7              C    Em/B   Am               D
Somewhere where I, I don't have to see your face
        D7          G         B7               Em  G/D
'Cause seeing your face only brings me out in tears...
C                G               D7               G  D7  G
Thinking of the love I've wasted all through the years....

     G7     C      D7        G   B7  Em
And baby I miss you, baby I miss you...
  G7              C
Remember when it didn't rain
D7                   G
Will I ever see the sun again
G7          C       D7       G   B7  Em
And baby I miss you, baby I miss you...
G7    C                       D7               G   C
And I only wish that I could share your love again..
      Am                      D7               G
And I only wish that I could share your love again
