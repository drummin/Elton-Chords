and now that it all over
    G7/B            Cm
the birds can nest again
         Eb            Bb/D
ill only snow when the sun comes out
  G7/B                         Cm
i shine only when it starts to rain
    Cm/Bb         F7/A
and if you want a drink
                Bb
just squeeze my hand
    Bb/A      Gm7           C7               F7
and wine will flow into the land and feed my lambs
G7-9          Cm
for im am the mirror 
G7/B              Cm
i can reflect the moon
             Eb        Bb/D
i will write songs for you

ill be your silver spoon
         G7/B        Cm
im sorry i took your time
            Fm6              G7
