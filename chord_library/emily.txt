Church bells ring out morning glory when summer bends to the winter's rage.

Emily walks through the cemetery.  Passed a dog in an unmarked grave.
C            F        G      C                      F       G      C
The old girl hobbles, nylons sagging.  Talks to her sisters in the ground
Am      F          G           C         Am        F        G    Am    G/B
I saw a lie in the mirror this morning.  I heard a prophecy all around.



CHORUS:
    F/C  C                  Fm/C     Db/Ab   Eb/Bb                 Dm7/F
And Em-i-ly - they come and go.  The shadows   -   and the distant sounds.
    F/C  C               Fm/C            Db/Ab     Eb/Bb             Dm7/F  C  F
But Em-i-ly - don't be afraid.  When the weight of angels weighs you down.



C     F          G     C                F              G      C
Emily prays to a faded hero in a little frame clutched to her gown.
Am        F                G      C
Hears the voice of promise in his memory.
Am            F                  G       C  F/G - Am7
Tonight's the night they let the ladder down.
C    F           G       C               F            G        C
In a cage sits a gold canary by a wicker chair and a rosewood loom.
Am   F             G         C        Am      F          G     Am    G/B
As a soul ascends aboard the evening, Canary sings to an empty room.
