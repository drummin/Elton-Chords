With all I ever cared for in your hand.

I'm waiting all the time  for  some kind of sign from you.

     And I'll go on and on this way.

Waiting for the day when I will hear you say you'll take me back.

When you  look    around you    for the love that you lack -
                  Ab          Cm7      F
    open up your heart little girl, oh-oh.

You got my heart little girl, oh-oh.
Bb      Ab          Cm7         F          Bb       Ab     Eb/G           Bb
Make a start little girl - and say you'll take me  back.         Take me back.
                      (Melody:  G   F      Ab  G   G-F-Eb)
