Little Dan and Becky waved goodbye
               Gm                          
They're gonna have to share the weight together

They watched his shadow fade around the bend
            Gm  
He's headed for a different kind of thunder
           E                     A7           Dm
And the stunned surprise in the eyes of dying men

The old black rooster sang him down that dirt road
     Dm                           /C    Bb
His step seemed bold, his manner fancy-free
           Gm
I pray we see him alive and well in the fall here
E                       A7         Dm
Than that God-forsaken place in Tennessee

[Repeat Chorus}

After all of this, if we should prevail

Heaven help the South when Sherman comes their way
