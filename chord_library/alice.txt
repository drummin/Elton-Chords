intro: Bbm

Bbm                        Gb
Raised to be a lady by the golden rule
Ebm                      Bbm
Alice was the spawn of a public school
                                 Gb
With a double barrel name in the back of her brain
      Ebm            Ab                   Bbm
And a simple case of mummy doesnt love me blues


Bbm                  Gb
Reality it seems was just a dream
    Ebm                        Bbm
She couldnt get it on with the boys on the scene
                                          Gb
But what do you expect from a chick whose just sixteen
    Ebm                 Ab                  Bbm
And hey hey hey hey hey hey you know what I mean

Gm7b5                    Gb7
All the young girls love Alice
Db                      Eb7
Tender yound Alice they say
     Bbm                   Gb
Come over and see me, come over and please me
Bbb        Cb      Bbm   (repeat chords for 2nd part of chorus)
Alice it's my turn today

All the young girls love Alice
Tender young Alice they say
If I give you my number will you promise to call me?
Wait till my husbands away


Poor little darling with a chip out of her heart
It's like acting in a movive When you've got the wrong part
Getting your kicks in another girls bed
And it was only last Tuesday when they you in the subway dead

And who could you call your friends down in Soho?
One or two middle aged dykes in a go-go?
And what do you expect from a sixteen year old yo-yo?
And hey hey hey hey hey hey dont you know

(repeat chorus)

outro: Bbm and fade
