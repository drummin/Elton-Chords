Like those cannons long ago

Five hundred wooden saints below
	C	G
The color's cracked and dry

You said their stories should be told

Did they suffer when they died?

Give us your tradition

Give us hope and send us home

We'll be the cracked bells tolling

The voice of dust and bones

The pillow that you dream on
	C	G
Lies rolled up on the floor
Bb		F
You tossed it at the TV screen

At the drug lord and his war

Thinking of the courtyard

Forced a tear from your eyes

The white shirts in the moonlight
		G
The warm forgiving smiles
