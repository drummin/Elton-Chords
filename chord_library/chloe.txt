Dm		          Bb
How come you're so understanding

C\D		       Dm
When I tell you all my lies

Dm		    Bb
And pretending to believe them

C\D		      Dm
See through all my alibis

Bb			 F    Eb\F
And I need you more than ever

Bb 			C
And I want you till the end

    Dm  Bb  C
Chloe


Dm			Bb
How you handle what you live through

C\D		    Dm
I can never hope to learn

Dm		      Bb
Taking all the pain I give you

C\D		     Dm
Loving blindly in return

Bb			 F    Eb\F
And I need you more than ever

Bb		      C
I will always be your friend

Dm    Bb C   F\A
Chloe,   Chloe

Chloe,    what you gonna do____

Bb	       C	F
What you gonna do about me


Dm			   Bb
You're the lifeline that I cling to

C\D			Dm
When I feel like giving in

Dm			 Bb
When the dreams that I rely on

C\D			 Dm
Start to wear a little thin

Bb    			   F   Eb\F
Then I need you more than ever

Bb			C
And I want you till the end
