I've been blown away like a printed page

	 	   C\E Dm
That reads "you're lovesick"

Bb\F     F 	     C\F Bb\F
Headline news had me so abused

	  C\E Dm
But I was lovesick


	  Gm		   Am	Dm
You never tried although I sacrificed

   Bb		  F    
My weaknesses for you

	   	  Gm7     	      Am	Dm
I could have understood, I could have read your looks

		    Gm     C   
I should have known better too

	  Bb\F    F       C\F          Bb\F
I've been holding out but it's time to shout

	     C\E Dm
You know I'm lovesick

  Bb\F    F	     C\F   Bb\F
A helping hand for a dying man

	      C\E Dm
Who says he's lovesick


	  Gm		 Am    Dm
I can't explain why I'll never change

      Bb	     F
This sickness deep inside

		   Gm7		      Am     Dm
I've been doctored down, I've had the nurse around

		Bb  C    
I've heard too many lies
