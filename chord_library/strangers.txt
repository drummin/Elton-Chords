C  G\B  Am  Dm C\E  F G  F\G


C                      G\B
Two people caught on a string

Em                         Am
A high-wire act above the center ring

          Dm7      G  Am
While the audience is wondering

         Bb           F\A
If we'll make it back


C		   G\B
Two people up on a wire

Em           Am
Overhead and under fire

          Dm7      G Am
While the audience enquire

        Bb           F\A
If it's just a knack


F\C  C     F\C           C          C\B  G\B
Strangers, after all, we find we're strangers

C\E   
After all this time

C\E   F    		    G
We've made the long and the lonely climb

    Am	      G           D7\F#
And now we've reached the part

      Dm C\E  Dm\F  G
Where we find we're strangers

        F         C\G      C     C  G\B  Am  C\G  Dm C\E  F G  F\G
We were strangers from the start


C			 G\B
Two people caught in the tide

Em             Am
On the edge of love and pride

    Dm7 	G    Am 
And both afraid to approach the side

    Bb         F\A
And fall again


C		       G\B
Two people playing the part

Em 		      Am
But which is life and which is art

    Dm7        G      Am
And isn't it a little late

            Bb        F\A
To start it all again

(REFRAIN)


Dm C\E  Dm\F  G
We find we're strangers

        F         C\G      C     C  G\B  Am  C\G  
We were strangers from the start

(REPEAT, FADE)
