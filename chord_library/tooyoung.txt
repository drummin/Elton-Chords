               D                  G/D                    D
Your mother's eyes look straight through me whenever we meet.
G/D          D                 G/D                D
Your father swears it'll never be  as long as he breathes.
D7/C          Bm              G                        A
And how many times have they told you that you're too young?
A7                      Bm      A - G                  A    Asus
How, how I've ached to hold you   -    but you're too young.



A7           D                   G/D               D
If we don't buy what's right or wrong then we are sinners.
G/D      D           G/D                             D
We were never two to tag along - but we were always winners.
D7/C          Bm           G                        A
And how many people, have told you that you're too young?
    A7                                    Bm      A - G                 
A   Asus
And how many jealous hands would love to hold you       'cos you're too 
young?



A7                         D      F#+                      Bm
Well you're too young to love me,     and I'm too old for you.
D7/A                       G       C/G-G                        A

At least that's what they tell us.       It's in their book of rules.
            A7                                D
That you're too young, too young baby you're too young.
F#+                    Bm     D7/A                                 G
We could try it for a while.        But they'd get us in the long run.
                     A7                          D      F#+   Bm   G  
Asus-A
They say that you're too young, baby you're too young.
