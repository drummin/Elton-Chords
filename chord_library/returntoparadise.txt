Intro: F   G   C/E   C   F   C/E   G


C    G7sus/D   G7       C    F/G - C         /D  C          G
It's par   -   a - dise here   -   where the sun meets the sea.
Dm          Am      Bb      Dm7  C/D     G    F/G
There's nothing to fear and so   much to be.
C   G7sus/D  G7     C   F/G  C      /D  C     G
But   soon   I must go,     say goodbye to it all.
Dm        Am      Bb       Dm7   C/D      G
That homeland of mine is begin - ning to call.



CHORUS:
    C    Dm                   G/B           C
Goodbye  -  doesn't mean this has to be the end.
F  G   C      C/G   F   C   G
Fading dreams grow cold as ice.
    C  Dm               G/B            C        F  G  C   C/G F  C G
And I  -  got a feeling we will meet again when we return to  paradise.


C    G7sus/D   G7      C    F/G - C         /D  C       G
The   wind     in our hair     -    and the sun in our eyes.
Dm         Am       Bb        Dm7  C/D      G    F/G
There's no need for tears and no   time for lies.
C  G7sus/D  G7        C   F/G - C           /D    C     G
So  reach   out your hand    -    and I'll reach out my heart.
Dm   Am  Bb       Dm7 C/D   G
Remember me while we  are apart.


{Repeat Chorus}


{no chord - vocal tacet}
I'm heading homeward.  Leaving sunshine and heading for rain.
    F     G  C   C/G F  C G    C   G7sus/D - G - C   C   G7sus/D - G - C
But we'll return to  paradise again.
