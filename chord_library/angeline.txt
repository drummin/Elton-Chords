Well I'm work shy.     I'm wild-eyed  -  so shut that door when the baby cries.

Maybe someday,      some way  -  somewhere in the future there's more pay.

Let me use you like a sex machine - Angeline.



CHORUS:       A    
You've got to swing that hammer, punch that card.

Angeline I love you when you work so hard.

Swing that hammer and sew my jeans.

Well I talk tough.     I act rough.      Lay still honey I can't get enough.

Keep your nose clean.   Let me be.   
                                /F#  /A   A          A         D/A-A
On your knees when you speak to me   and  trust me - Angeline.

Talk real dirty and I'll make you scream - Angeline.
