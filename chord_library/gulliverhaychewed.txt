GULLIVER

(gb  b  e  a)*

Gm  

Gm  		       Gm\F                 Eb
Gulliver's gone to the final command of his master

F		    Bb				  Ab
His watery eyes had washed all the hills with his laughter

	Bb					 	      Ab
And the seasons can change all the light from the grey to the dim

Gm				   F
But the light in his eyes will see no more bright

       Cm7		           C\D  D7
As the sheep that he locked in the pen


	G		       G\F
There's four feet of ground in front of the barn

       C			     G
That's sun baked and rain soaked and part of the farm

G		      G\F
But now it lies empty so cold and so bare

C			G
Gulliver's gone but his memory lies there

Gm

   Gm			    Gm\F		 Eb
By passing the doors of his life was a stage I remember

       F		    Bb			     Ab
And in later years he would cease to bare teeth to a stranger

    Bb
For sentiment touched him as Cyclamen holds him

     Ab
And later men came from the town

    Gm			      F
Who said clear the child this won't take a while

    Cm7	 		     C\D  D7
And Gulliver's gone with the dawn

(CHORUS)

(CHORUS, PROGRESSIVELY FASTER)

G       G\F   C      G
Ay, ay ay, ay ay, ay ay.

G      G\F    C      G
Ay, ay ay, ay ay, ay ay(ayayayayayayayayayayaa!)
