You Can Make History (Young Again)
by: Elton John and Bernie Taupin

intro: D - Bm - Em - C - G/A

D                   Em/D
I can feel the time closing in
A                              Bm
I can feel the years crawling through my skin
          F#                Bm
And if I doubt myself I can count on the rain
    Em                     Em-sus  A
To cover the tears of this aging game

D                              Em/D
But I can count on you to play your part
A                                Bm
I don't miss a beat of your animal heart
              F#                Bm
And when you push from behind I know I can
   Em                         Em-sus  A
Cover a mountain with the palm of my hand

        D	  D/B	                 Em
And oh babe, you can make history young again
A			
You could rewrite, you could decide
                  D	       
The things that should or shouldn't have been
C                  B                    Em
You could look at me in the scheme of things
D/A	   E/G#                    G   A   D
Oh babe, you could make history young again

D                       Em/D
I can watch the weeks sweeping by
A                                  Bm
I can recollect the hearts hanging out to dry
		F#                   Bm
When the world shuts down I can touch my fears
	Em                      Em-sus   A
I can hear lost youth ringing in my ears

D                       Em/D
But I lost nothing when I gained you
A                           Bm
You just blew me away with yesterdays news
            F#              Bm
When you run your fingers down my spine
	Em                           Em-sus     A
It's like throwing a switch on the hands of time

G               A/G
Ancient minds, ancient lives
       D
Got a way of coming around
G                   A/G
If I knew then what I know now
D                    Bm      C   A
I'd make it back to you somehow
