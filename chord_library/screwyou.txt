Music: Elton John
Lyrics: Bernie Taupin
Album: B-side single from 1973


G                        C
When I was a boy I had a lot of fun
F                           C                 G
I lived by the sea, I was a fisherman's son
   Am               Dm
My mother she was a fisherman's wife
        G                G7          C
She was scrubbing floors most of her life


          F          C  Dm7  C
They said screw you
  F                    C     Dm7  C
I ain't got nothing to lose
        F     
I could paper a matchbox
          C    G7       C    Dm7  C
With the money I use

At the school I attended I got into fights
I was beaten in an alley on a cold winter night
The teachers cared less for the blood in our veins
They got most of their thrills out of using a cane

They said screw you
Oh you bloody young fools
I could get more sense
Out of the back end of a mule


C          Am7    
So you see there's man who get paid for being slaves
    F6
And men who get paid for being free
            G
And there's men behind bars who pray for the light
    C
And men in the suburbs who pray for the night
            Am7
And they're all trying to climb to the top of the mine
    F               D7/F#
And all of them say most of the way
F     C      Dm7/C  C  F  C  Dm7/C  C  F  C G7  C  F  C  F  C
Screw you

I worked in the mill from seven till nine
Tears in my eyes nearly drove me half-blind
Trying to make wages that weren't even there
Taking hell from a foreman with the build of a bear

He said screw you
This is all you'll ever do
It's the only existence for someone like you
