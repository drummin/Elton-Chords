Fm
It's so hard to say goodbye

	     Fm
When there's nothing left to give

	  Bbm
When this house is just a hill of bones

      Fm
Where you and I once lived

      Fm
If we put it back together

         Fm
By the skin of our teeth

	    Bbm
You'd still pull it all apart

       Fm
Bit by bit, piece by piece


	 Fm
And I'll go it alone

Bbm
Call this house my home

Ab7			       Fm
Build it up again with someone new

Fm
Build it brick by brick

	Bbm
Till I find a girl that fits

     Ab7			       Fm
This home's a whole lot better without you

Fm  Bbm  Fm  Bbm


Fm
There's no passion alive

	 Fm
When you count your phony schemes

	Bbm
And the cars you drive to buy your friends

	   Fm
They don't ever come back clean

       Fm
If the cards on the table

Fm
Always turn up spades

     Bbm
The cards that always cheat the hearts

    Fm
The spades you play just dug my grave

(REPEAT, FADE)



The fun with playing this piece comes in the bass.

For Fm:

F F G  Ab  G C F F G Ab  Ab G

Bbm:

Bb Bb C  Db  C F Bb Bb C Db  Db C

Ab7:

G G Ab  Bb  Ab AB G G Ab Bb

Listen to the recording for rhythms and stuff. 

I highly reccommend using these bass lines, and getting to know them.

This is where the song gets its drive from.  Without those base lines, it is a very boring song to play.
