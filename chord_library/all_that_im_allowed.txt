Verse 1:               C#                           Ab/C#    
             Breaking down never seems to be that hard.  
                        B/C#             F#/C#
             Falling short is always in the cards.
                              C#                  Ab/C#
             Among the road, sun rising up my back,
                      B/C#                   F#/C#
             Lost it all somewhere between the cracks.
                          Ebm                    Ab
             I always hoped that I'd do better.
                                    Ebm              Ab
             That I'd come out on top for once.
                       Am                      Bbm
             We all get what we're delivered.
                              Ebm             Ab
             Then there are the lucky ones.


                                  C#
Chorus:  And I've got all that I'm allowed.  
                   C#/C   C#/A#
              It'll do for me.

              I'm thankful now.
                     C#/G#   F#
              The walls get higher everyday.
                           Ab          C#/A#
              The barriers get in the way,
                            Eb                                        C#
              But I see hope in every cloud, and I'm thankful,
              Ab/C#     B/C#                F#
              Thankful.  I'm thankful, so thankful;  
                    Ebm                   B        Ab    C#
              I'm thankful I've got all that I'm allowed.



Verse 2:              C#                          Ab/C#
              Leaving town gets to feel just like a job.  
                        B/C#                F#/C#
              My desire never winds up on top.
                              C#               Ab/C#
              I can't say now I didn't want to moon.
                             B/C#
              It's out of reach:
                                    F#/C#
              Somewhere beyond this room.
                           Ebm                    Ab
              I always hoped that I'd do better,
                                    Ebm               Ab
              That I'd come out on top for once.
                         Am                     Bbm
              We all get what we're delivered,
                               Ebm             Ab
              Then there are the lucky ones.

Bridge:                   B                            F#
            I've always tried to make things clear.
                       A               E            F#
            Then I watched as progress stalled.
                     B                          F#
            I only hope I'm standing here
                        F#/F  Ebm                 Ab
            When heaven finally comes to call.
