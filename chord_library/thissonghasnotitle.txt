Dm                           Am  Bb            F
            1) Tune me in to the wild side of  life.
 2) Let me drink deeply from the water and the wine.
3) Take me down alleys where the murders  are  done.

     Bb                    F                C           F     F-C/E
          1) I'm  an inno-cent young child sharp as a  knife.
        2) Light coloured can - dles  in   dark dreary mines.
3) In a vast high powered rocket  to  the  core of the sun.

   Dm                            Am  Bb            F
1) Take me to the garretts where the artists have died.
           2) Look in the mirror and stare at  my-self.
        3) Want to read books in the studies  of  men.

   Bb                               A7         | Dm  / / Dm-C | Dm / / 
/ |
1) Show me the courtrooms where the judges have lied.  {go to Verse 2}
     2) And wonder if that's really me  on  the shelf. {go to Chorus}
          3) Born on the breeze and die on the wind.   {go to Chorus}



CHORUS:
Bb                           Eb
And each day I learn just a little bit more.
Ab                     Db
I don't know why but I do know what for.
Bb                           Eb7              Ab
If we're all going somewhere let's get there soon.
          Db           Gb          | G     /    Bb/C / | F/C / C / |
Oh, this song's got no title - just words and a tune. {1st time: go to 
Verse 3}
                                                      {2nd time: go to 
Bridge}
                                                      {3rd time: end in 
F}


BRIDGE:
Dm             F/C      Bb              F
If I was an artist who paints with his eyes -
Bb            F          C         F
I'd study my subject and silently cry.
Dm                           Bb      F
Cry for the darkness to come down on me.
       Bb                 A7  Dm  A7   Dm
For confusion to carry on turning the wheel.


{Repeat Chorus}
