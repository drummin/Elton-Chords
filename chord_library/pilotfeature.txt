Can you tell me how old Dan might have done it

F7\A                   Cm Cm Cm
If he'd been here now, holy cow

                                     C          
My stars might have been read on the planet Mars

E                                 Am
Because I don't have foresight to see

                               Cm
If we still be together in the twenty first

                         C
In the twenty first century


C                    E
He's our flying ace, pilot of the future

F7\A                 Cm Cm Cm
In an endless space, holy cow

                                    C
My eyes never saw a rocket that was quite that size

E                        Am
Because I don't have the energy

                            Cm
To be cat and mouse for the champions

                          C
For the champions of destiny

So long captain Dan

I fail to see what motivates your hands

F7\A C         
Goodbye restless night

           D      
You know I loved Dan Dare, but I couldn't make his flight

   C   F\C C    Fm
So long,     so long

Dan Dare doesn't know it

F\C               F F\A

But I liked the Mekon
