D7
When I look back boy I must have been green
G
Bopping in the country, fishing in a stream
D7
Looking for an answer trying to find a sign
G
Until I saw your city lights honey I was blind


          B7
They said get back honky cat

Better get back to the woods
      E7
Well I quit those days and my redneck ways
    D7                                  G
And oh the change is gonna do me good

          B7
You better get back honky cat

Living in the city ain't where it's at
          E7
It's like trying to find gold in a silver mine
         D7                                             G
It's like trying to drink whisky from a bottle of wine


       D7
Well I read some books and I read some magazines
           G
About those high class ladies down in New Orleans
            D7
And all the folks back home well, said I was a fool
         G
They said oh, believe in the Lord is the golden rule


          B7
They said get back honky cat

Better get back to the woods
      E7
Well I quit those days and my redneck ways
    D7                                  G
And oh the change is gonna do me good

Better get back to the woods
      E7
Well I quit those days and my redneck ways
    D7                                  G
And oh the change is gonna do me good



          D7
They said stay at home boy, you gotta tend the farm
G
Living in the city boy, is going to break your heart
    D7
But how can you stay, when your heart says no
    G
How can you stop when your feet say go


          B7
They said get back honky cat

Better get back to the woods
      E7
Well I quit those days and my redneck ways
    D7                                  G
And oh the change is gonna do me good

          B7

          E7
It's like trying to find gold in a silver mine
         D7                                             G
It's like trying to drink whisky from a bottle of wine


D7                                                 G
   Get back honky cat, get back honky cat, get back
D7                                                 G
   Get back honky cat, get back honky cat, get back
D7                                                 G
   Get back honky cat, get back honky cat, get back
