Intro: Ab  Fm  Db  Db/Eb


     Ab                  Bbm/Ab 
When stars are born, are they cast out

   Eb                      Db      Ab
To wander cold and lonely lost in space?

  Bbm-5     Bbm-5/Ab  Ab                 Bbm
A loveless point of  light that can't return

                  Eb 
Forever fixed within one place 



     Ab               Bbm/Ab    
When love is lost and dreams are cast

     Eb                          Db      Ab    
Like bruised and battered pieces left to die,

     Bbm-5      Bbm-5/Ab   Ab 
When hands that reach out  are betrayed

    Bb                   Dm-5 Eb
How can my tortured soul sur--vive? 



             Cm        Fm 
There's only one thing left

               Db                        Eb  
And that's the one thing that you needed most of all,

        Cm                Fm 
For the freedom that you gained

       Db               Fm/C           F#    Bbm/F   Eb 
Is the loss that led me aimless to the shore. 



        Ab    Ab/G          Fm    Fm/Eb
And I'm borne high on these waves

Db           Fm/C      Eb      
Swept by the wind and alone.

    Ab       Ab/G  Fm7     Fm7/Eb     Bbm/Db  Db  Eb  
Oh, sail me away, carry me back to my home.


    Db 
I'm tired, I've been torn,

  Eb                    C7                       Fm   
A cruel, wretched storm churns like a gale in my bones.

   Fm/Eb    Bbm Db Dbmaj7/Eb  Eb7+C      Ab    Cm/G  Fm  
Oh sail me away,   carry me   back to my home.

Oh sail me away,   carry me   back to my home. 





      Ab                  Bbm/Ab    
These scars run deep, The future holds

         Eb                      Db      Ab 
A hunger for your innocence That passed away.

     Bbm-5   Bbm-r/Eb Ab  
Your callous shadows mock

            Bb     
And make it clear some things

                        dm-5 Eb 
Were not enough to make you stay. 



           Cm          Fm
The moment time stands still

       Db                        Eb     
Is the moment that the writing's on the wall.

    Cm                 Fm
The words are clear as ringing bells,

     Db                Fm/C             F#    Bbm/F  Eb 
That pride was present right before the fall. 




        Ab    Ab/G          Fm    Fm/Eb
And I'm borne high on these waves

Db           Fm/C      Eb      
Swept by the wind and alone.

    Ab       Ab/G  Fm7     Fm7/Eb     Bbm/Db  Db  Eb  
Oh, sail me away, carry me back to my home.

I'm tired, I've been torn,

A cruel, wretched storm churns like a gale in my bones.
