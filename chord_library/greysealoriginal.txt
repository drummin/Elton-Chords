C\D  Dsus  D

Em              D          G
Why's it never light on my lawn?
            Am             G            Bm  C      D
Why does it rain and never say good-day to the new-born?
C6  D  Em               D          G
On the big screen they showed us a sun -
           Am         G          Bm - C  D
but not as bright in life as the  real   one.
           Am         G          Bm - C   D
It's never quite the same as the  real   one.



CHORUS:
B            F#                   B7sus         E
And tell me grey seal how does it feel to be so wise?
B              F#             B7sus      E      
To see through eyes that only see what's real.  
B - F#  A   E    B        C# - D - B   A# - B - G   C# - D - F   E  {twice}
Tell    me grey seal.    /F# -/G      /C# -/D      /A# -/B      /C



        Em              D        G
I never learned why meteors were formed.
       Am        G                    Bm   C   D
I only farmed in schools that were so worn and torn.
C6 D  Em               D      G
If anyone can cry then so can I.
       Am             G     Bm - C   D
I read books and draw life from the eye.
       Am      G         Bm - C   D
All my life is drawings from the eye.


{Repeat Chorus}


             Em                    D        G
Your mission bells were wrought by ancient men.
               Am                G                     Bm - C   D
The roots were formed by twisted roots your roots were twisted then.
C6 D     Em               D         G
I was re-born before all life could die.
            Am                   G        Bm - C - D
The Phoenix bird will leave this world to fly.
       Am               G        Bm - C   D
If the Phoenix bird can fly then so  can  I.

(CHORUS)

D7sus D7  D7sus D7 D7sus  D7  D7sus D7   D7sus D7  D7sus D7            D7sus  D7
		   Tell   me Grey   Seal,          how   love can feel.
