 - Am/D x2

G/D
Don't abandon life
Am/D
Don't step away
G/D
Don't give up that tune
Am/D
That you never could play
G
If you're folding your tent
G#dim
And the gas pipes groan
Am
If every bone rattles
Bm - C
Through nights all alone
G/D
Well you're tougher than leather
Am/D
No old burlap sack
G/D
Not some hard scrabble weeds
Am/D
Growing up through the cracks

C/D G G#dim 
Don't you know, you're never too old
Am Bm - C
You're never too old to hold somebody
C - C/D - G G#dim
Don't you know, you're never too old
Am Bm - C
You're never too old to hold somebody
Cm6 C/D C/G - G
You're never too old to hold somebody

F C/E
I could bet on a horse
C/G - G
But I'm betting on you
F C/E
You still got what it takes
Am/D C/D
You got nothing, nothing to prove
