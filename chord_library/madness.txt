Intro:  Dm      Bb/D     C/D - C#dim/D     Dm

    Dm      Bb/D    C/D     C#dim/D  Dm         Dm     Bb/D   C/D  C#dim/D  Dm    
The fuse is set and checked once    more.  Then left beside a back street  door.
    Bb /Bb-/F-/Bb-/Bb /F  C/Bb /Bb-/F-/Bb-/Bb  /F  F/A  /A-/F-/A-/A /F  
And in                the cold                grey light - 
Eb/Bb  Bb   F/Bb  Bb  Eb/Bb  Bb   F/Bb  Bb      F/Bb  Bb        C/Bb   F/A
Some - one  sees  a    sha - dow  run  through  the  night, and out of sight


     Dm     Bb/D   C/D   C#dim/D  Dm      Dm      Bb/D     C/D  C#dim/D  Dm    
They hide inside a smoke filled  room, to hear at last the blast  of     doom.
    Bb /Bb-/F-/Bb-/Bb /F  C/Bb /Bb-/F-/Bb-/Bb  /F  F/A  /A-/F-/A-/A /F  
And so                the deed                 is  done -
     Eb/Bb Bb  F/Bb  Bb  Eb/Bb  Bb  F/Bb  Bb   F/Bb  Bb   C/Bb   F/A  A7
They lis - ten  to   the   fi - nal count-down  be - gun, three, two, one.


Gm7                     Bb/C  C               F    Cm6/Eb  Dsus
Madness, it's a kind of mad - ness that turns good  men    bad.
D         Gm7                       Bb/C  C         Dm    Bbmaj7  A
And we're helpless caught up in the mad - ness of a world gone    mad.


    Dm      Bb/D       C/D  C#dim/D  Dm     Dm           Bb/D   C/D  C#dim/D Dm    
The roar of fire rings out    on     high & flames light up the black night  sky
  Bb /Bb-/F-/Bb-/Bb  /F    C/Bb /Bb-/F-/Bb-/Bb  /F  F/A  /A-/F-/A-/A /F  
A child            screams out                  in fear -
  Eb/Bb Bb  F/Bb Bb  Eb/Bb  Bb  F/Bb  Bb   F/Bb  Bb   C/Bb     F/A  
A hope-less cry  for help   but  no   one   is  near enough to hear

Instr: A     Dm/A     B7/A     Em/G     B7/F#     Em     B7     C     F/A     B7

   Em       C/E     D/E D#dim/E  Em         Em       C/E         D/E D#dim/E Em
As walls collapse & tim-bers    flare - the smell of death hangs in   the    air
     C /C-/G-/C-/C  /G  D/C /C-/G-/C-/C  /G  G/B  /B-/G-/B-/B /G  
When help           at  last             ar-rives -
     F/C C  G/C   C   F/C   C   G/C  C     G/C  C       D/C       G/B     B7
They try to fight the flame but no - thing sur-vives of all those lives

Instr:  Em     C/E     D/E - D#dim/E     Em   {repeated}

         Em       C/E          D/E   D#dim/E  Em
And it's madness, every time a vic -   tim    dies.
         Em       C/E               D/E    D#dim/E  Em   D   C   D
There is madness, burning in a      blind  man's   eyes.
And it's madness, hidden in the     hate   and     pain.
There is madness, burning in a      wild   man's   brain.
And it's madness, every time the    bul -  lets    start.
There is madness, burning in a      poor   man's   heart.
And it's madness, something that we can't  con  -  troll.
There is madness, burning in a      mad -  man's   soul.    Madness.

Em       C/E               D/E    D#dim/E  Em   D   C   D
Madness.	           Ma____________dness.
(Repeat, ad lib, fade),
