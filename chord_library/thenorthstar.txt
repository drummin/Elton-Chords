Dm                                  Gm
Can't always count on the prayers in your sleep

C                              Bb add C/F  F 
But this cold light still kil-------ling me

F/E  Dm                                   Gm 
If      I pay the ransom well can they guarantee

                  Am                 Bb add C  
To split the chains, slip the knots?

                   F                    G7      C7 C 
Don't know if they'll every set you free.


F/C  C  F/C

(Same as 1st verse.)
Just can't rely on all these twisted signs.
Too many bright lights turn you blind.
The history of the blues seems to swim in your eyes.
Pick yourself up, through your head back,
Take a long, long look into the sky.

F/C C

              F      
Are you out there?

             Am/E
Are you listening?

         Dm7    Cm6  Cm   Bb6 Bb
Am I coming acro--ss to you? 

Eb/Bb Bb Bb/A

         Gm
Is the North Star still shining

         F/A                     C6 C 
In the sky outside your room?

F/C C

              F
You can listen,

                 Am/E
But they're lying.

                      Dm7                       Cm6   Cm   Bb6 Bb   
Don't let them tell you what you've al-----ways known.

Eb/Bb Bb (1st and 2nd time) (3rd time to fine.)

Bb/A            Gm
Yeah, it's the North Star that's the big one
 
             F/A               A/C#     F          
And it's always gonna lead you home.

(1st time.)
Bb/F F Am/E Dm C Bb Dm C Bb
(2nd time to bridge.)


(Same as 1st verse.)
Can't always agree on all my dumb ideas.
I'm still looking for a way out of here.
You can value what you want but you pay for change.
There's full moons, cloudless nights,
Tumbled stars spelling out your name.

(Bridge) F 

                  Bb               Bb                   
Close your eyes, take a ride,

               Bb           Gm                Am          
Think of every time you've missed out.

                 Bb                     Bb
Click your heals, see how it feels.

Bb                             Gm           G            C   
Something so childish sometimes seems so real.

(Fine:)

Bb/A            Gm
Yeah, it's the North Star that's the big one
 
             F/A               A/C#     F          
And it's always gonna lead you home
