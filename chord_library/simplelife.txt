	  Bb\F F	   Bb\F F
There's a breakdown on the run- way

	Bb\F F	  Fm           F
And the time-less flights are gone

      Bb\F F F    F\A F\C Eb   Eb    Bb\D 
I'm a year a-head of  my- self these days

	F\D   Fm\D    F
And I'm locomotive strong

   Bb\F F              Bb\F F
My ci-  ty spread like can- non fire

     Bb     Eb\Bb Bb\F   F
In a yellow ner-  vous state

  Bb\F  F  F\A F\C Eb   Eb   Bb\D F\D
I can't cut    the ties that bind me

   F\D	      Fm\D F
To horoscopes and fate


       Eb\Bb Bb		  Eb\Bb Bb
And I won't  break and I won't bend

    Eb\Bb Bb  Bb          Bb\F F
But some- day soon we'll sail away

       C     Bb             F   Eb\F
To innocence and the bitter end

       Eb\Bb  Bb         Eb\Bb Bb
And I won't break and I won't bend

	     Eb\Bb Bb       Bb Bb\F F
And with the last    breath we ever take

		C	    Bb            C     F
We're gonna get back to the simple life aga____in

(All right!)


	Bb\F  F           Bb\F F
When we break out of this blindfold

	  Bb\F F   Fm        F
I'm gonna take you from this place

  Bb\F F     F    F\A  F\C  Eb   Eb  Bb\D
Until  we're free from this ball and chain

	  F\D         Fm\D F
I'm still hard behind the  eight

   Bb\F F             Bb\F F 
My ci-  ty beats like ham- mered steel

       Bb    Eb\Bb Bb    F
On a shallow cru_____el rock

 	    Bb\F F     F F\A F\C Eb Eb Bb\D
If we could walk proud after     mi____dnight

     F\D        Fm\D F
We'd never have to stop
