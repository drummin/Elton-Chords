Music: Elton John

Bb6
Blue Eyes
F/A    Fm/Ab    Gm 
Baby's got blue eyes
            Eb11
Like a deep blue sea
Bb/D            F/C
On a blue, blue day
Bb6
Blue Eyes
F/A    Fm/Ab    Gm
Baby's got blue eyes
            Eb11     
When the morning comes
                 Em7-5
I'll be far away
A
And I say
Dm                               Bb/D
Blue eyes holding back the tears
                 F
Holding back the pain
F/A    Fm/Ab    Gm
Baby's got blue eyes
          Eb11   Bb/C  C       F  Eb Ab Gb Db/F Ab/Eb Eb 
And she's alone          again

Blue eyes
Baby's got blue eyes
Like a clear blue sky
watching over me
Blue eyes
ooh, I love blue eyes
When I'm by her side
Where I long to be
I will see

Blue eyes lauging in the sun
Lauging in the rain
Baby's got blue eyes
And I am home

Bb/C     C
And I am home again

repeat back to "Blue eyes lauging in the rain..."

outro: Eb Ab Gb Db/F Ab/Eb Eb
