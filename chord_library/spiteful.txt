by: Elton John

Intro: C/E - D/F

                 Am  G/B   C                       Am  G/B  C
I don't want to worry you none but I got the hurt on the run
   C                  Em                     C                   
I just cut out the poison that was in me so long
              Am  G/B   C                Am    G/B  C
Watching you tear out my heart only gave me the last laugh
   C                    Em                            C  
Watching you tear out your hair is gonna be the best part

                     C  G/B  Bb  F/A          C/G        G
Oh I've been shaken down................ by a spiteful child
                         C  G/B  Bb  F/A          C/G    G
I've slapped a worried frown............ on that evil smile
                     C  G/B  Bb  F/A           C/G       G
I've been taken down.................... by a spiteful child
                         C  G/B  Bb  F/A          C/G       G
I've turned the tables round............ and it drives you wild
Bb          C    G
Oh you spiteful child

                 Am  G/B   C                     Am  G/B  C
You'd better be ready to run, now I've got you under the gun
   C                  Em                            C        
I put my money on vengeance before this race had begun
              Am  G/B   C               Am    G/B  C
Breaking the spirit in me only added to your conceit
   C                    Em                            C  
Playing you at your own game is going to make it complete
