It's so strange he doesn't show me more affection than he needs

       Cm			     Abmaj7\F
Almost formal, too respectful, never takes romantic leads

	  Abmaj7\F		       G7\B
There are times when I imagine I'm not always on his mind

	 Cm	           Bb		    Ab
He's not thinking what I'm thinking, always half a beat behind

       Fm7\Bb
Always half a beat behind

       Bb				F\A
I'm in every kind of trouble, can't you tell, just look at me

       Gm	  	             Cm\F
Half ecstatic, half dejected, all in all I'm all at sea

     Cm				       D
Easy turns I thought I wanted, fill me now with chilling dread

	Gm	       Bb\F	   Bb
You can never know the chaos, of a life turned on it's head

     Bb\F		 F
Of a life turned on it's head

Eb  F\A  Cm  Ab F

       Bb			       F\A
Take a little time to panic, shake off your complacent state

       Gm			  Cm\F
I know all I ever wished to, of a life destroyed by fate

	Cm			    D
It's so strange you never notice anything but where you are

        Gm		   Bb\F		 F
Step outside your gleaming prison, or is that a step too far

      Bb\F	      F
Or is that a step too far
