Trust Me
Music by Elton John
Lyrics by Tim Rice
Available on the album soundtrack The Road To El Dorado

Bb7     Eb/Bb     Bb7

Bb7
Looking back it makes me shiver
Bb7
Don't be scared to kick the past
Eb/Bb
Selling lovers down the river
F/Bb				   Eb/Bb Bb
Nothing built for speed will last overnight

Bb7
All those years of desolation
Bb7
Pretty boys and damage done
Eb/Bb
Not the way to find salvation
F/Bb
Looking after number one

Eb/Bb  Bb
Trust me
Eb/Ab  Bb/Ab
Trust me
    Eb/G         Bb/G (or Gm7)
I'm giving you a chance, so take it
Eb/Ab        Bb/Ab
I got all you want, you'll make it
Eb/G              Bb/G (or Gm7)
Standing there in front of me, you're naked
F#				      Eb
You can't hide a thing, you've got no choice
	Bb7
Trust me

Too many years your heart has wandered
Scared to make a final move
Too many nights those boys have squandered
You got nothing left to prove

Trust me
Trust me
I'm giving you a chance, so take it
I got all you want, you'll make it
Standing there in front of me, butt naked
You can't hide a thing, you've got no choice
Trust Me
Trust Me
Trust Me
Trust Me
Trust Me
