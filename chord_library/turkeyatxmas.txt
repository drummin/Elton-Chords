C       G\B        Am        G       F      C\E       Dm
Sitting here on Christmas Eve with a brandy in my hand

        G             C             F                    G7
Oh I've had a few too many and it's getting hard to stand

C          G\B   Am  G F        C\E     Dm
I keep hearing noises  from my fireplace

  G             C            G                    C 
I must be going crazy or the brandy's won the race


    F C\E  Dm  C   F     F  F G               G
And I keep hearing ho ho ho,  guess who's here

     C       C           G          C
Your fat and jolly friend draws near

F     F  F   G              G
Ho ho ho, surprise, surprise

    C       C        G           C
The bearded weirdy's just arrived

F     F  F G               G
Ho ho ho,  guess who's here

     C       C     G                C
Your fat and jolly friend draws near

F     F  F   G             G
Ho ho ho, surprise surprise

    C       C        G          C
The bearded wierdy's just arrived



C     G\B          Am              G    F        C\E        Dm
On my roof there's snorting sounds, and bells inside my head

   G                      C          F                 G7
My vision's blurred with colour, and all he sees is red

          C       G\B         Am     G F       C\E        Dm
There's a pair of large sized wellies  coming down my flue

        G                C             C\G     G          C
And the smell of burning rubber, oh is filling up the room
