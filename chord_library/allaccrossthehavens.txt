All Across the Havens
(Bonus track on Empty Sky)
Elton John

Chords by Dante Horvath


Intro: G C7 G C7

G
The sister of sunlight

C7
Comes to my lonely life

G
Bearing the crosses I hung

C7
I hung on my lonely wife

Bm
And the anchor told me

Em
If I prayed by the river

Am7
That the sweet sound of water

D7
Would always go with her


     G         Bm/F#         Em
All across the havens to the waterfall

     F
They told me I would meet her there

     Am7
Inside those icy walls

    F
But how on earth in this universe

            C             D7
Can they forgive me of my pains

G                  Am7
For all across the havens

C                    C/B Am7      D7
I must stumble locked in chains


Interlude:
G C7 G C7


G
Then the mother of mercy

C7
Showed me her stable

G
And told me you would be safe

C7
Safe in her cradle

Bm
And the waterfall opened

Em
And the water withdrew

Am7
Leaving me standing

D7
On a road leading through

(Chorus)

Outtro:
