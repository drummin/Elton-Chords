G	       F
Do you pray to someone new

	    C			 G
When you're locked up in the rock

G                 F
Is the golden age dead and gone

        C			G
Are the hands stuck on the clock

G  		F
Can you talk to Buddy's bones

	 C		  G
When you spin a forty five

G       		  F
The king ain't dead, he's just asleep

C
Somewhere in the after life


		     G   F           C
And look at them boys in leather jackets

C                C     G
Second skin, not fade away

	    G     F       C
Danger girls love leather jackets

F    E       D         		      G
Play back to back, and that'll be the day

F               C               G   F C  G  F C
Leather jackets, that'll be the day


G	       F
We all need to smell the heat

  	      C				
You know that things go better with chrome

   G 		   F
Is Memphis real or just a song

      C			      G
Three thousand miles from home

G		
Be a cool jerk, don't work

     C		         G
When fashion makes you change

G               F
Keep the faith, don't waste

        C
Another nickel on another name

(CHORUS)

F\C
And idolise twisted cars

F\C
Like taxi cabs and spiders

D7
Eternity's just down the road

E
They're looking for more riders

(CHORUS)

(REPEAT, FADE)
