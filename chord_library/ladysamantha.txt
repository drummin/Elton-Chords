Lady Samantha
Music: Elton John
Words: Bernie Taupin
Album: 1968 UK Single

Ebm    Gb    Ab7    Bb

Eb
When the shrill winds are screaming
F
And the evening is still
Bbm   Db/Ab          Fm
Lady Samantha glides over the hill
     Eb                        Ab7         Db
In a long satin dress that she wears every day
G               Bbm      Ebm             F7
Her home is the hillside, her bed is the grave


Bb            D7/A
Lady Samantha glides like a tiger
Eb                  Bb
Over the hills with no one beside her
       F
No one comes near
Eb               Ab
They all live in fear
    F              Ab        Eb         Bb    F    (repeat)
But Lady Samantha, she sheds only tears


The tales that I told round the fire every night
Are out of proportion and none of them right
She is harmless and empty of anything bad
For she once had something that most of you have

to chorus then outro

Ebm    Gb    Ab7    Ebm
