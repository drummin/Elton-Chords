Ebm       Ab7                      Db                       C  Db   Bb7/D - Ebm
Tune in, wouldn't it be something?    Rumours spreading into pa-nic.
Ebm                Ab7              Gb                          Db        Bb7/D
I've seen movements in the clearing.  Someone sent you something  satanic.
Ebm                 Ab7                Db                 C   Db   C   Db
I have to leave you,   radar's calling.  Outside somebody lan-ded.
Ebm              Ab7                   Gb                    Db
Crazy wavelengths   leave you helpless.  Oh, don't forget me - I'm so stranded.



CHORUS:
B                            Ebm
I wouldn't fool you but I've  -  seen the saucers
 Abm7                         Gb
     so many times I'm almost - in tune.
Absus     Ab  Abm  Bb7         Ebm    /Db  B       B/A#  Ab            Gb   F
Watching them  -  flying in formation  -  thinking how I could be so immune.
B              Ebm
I've seen them.   I been there with them.  
Abm7                         Gb
     I can tell you all you want to know.
Absus           Ab        Abm     Bb7          Ebm     /Db
     Something touched me  -  and  I was only sleeping.
B                                  Gb      F   {Intro}
Wouldn't you, wouldn't you like to go?



Ebm            Ab7                    Db                 C            Db - Bb7/D 
Stars climbing  -  into their planets.  Systems won, controlled from birth.
Ebm          Ab7                 Gb               Db             Bb7/D
Empty living  -  on this highway - can you see me mother earth?
Ebm             Ab7
It's so endless  -  whirling onward.
Db                        C      Db   C - Db 
Wonder what's cooking at home tonight.
Ebm                       Ab7
Maybe if I promise not to say a word -
     Gb                               Db
     they can get me back before the morning light.


{Repeat Chorus, end in Db}
