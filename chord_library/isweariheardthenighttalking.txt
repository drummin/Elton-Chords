I Swear I Heard The Night Talking
Music by Elton John
Lyrics by Bernie Taupin
UK B-Side (1990)

[Intro (where each || represents one measure of 4/4)]:
| F | F | C/E | C/E | Dm | Dm | Bb(add9) | Bb(add9) |

F		     C/E
In the nicotine glare of a cold naked light
Dm			     Bb
I drag my body from the covers and down forty flights
F				  C/E
I run out the front door into the center of the street
Dm					Bb
I scream out your name as the steam just swells around my feet

I hear you after midnight from the inner city
As every Cinderella turns to drop dead pretty
We were built out of the darkness into this West Side Story
We came together in the shadows but the moon just steals our glory

[Bridge]:
C
Well this is my battleground baby
Dm
This is my plaything
Bb
The only thing I've ever known
C
Outside of a wedding ring

[Chorus]:
	F		   C/E
And I swear I heard the night talking
		Bb      F		    C
Cursing me for being a little more than hopeless
  F			    C/E		     Dm
Telling me we're running lonely, loose and broken
		Bb	    F			C
Stronger now on passion but haven't we really spoken
	    Bb			C
And all we ever do ...
			  F
Is listen to the night talking
		    ^^^ (at this point go to Coda on final chorus)
| F | C/E | C/E | Dm | Dm | Bb | Bb(add9) |

On the burden of insanity we can't find the cause
On a flatbed truck well the home girl she paints her claws
There's a coward who gets his courage undercover of the dark
And it's a strange breed of devil freeze at night to go walking in the park

[Bridge]
[Chorus] (repeat bridge and chorus once, 2nd time chorus go to coda when 
prompted)

[Coda]:
   ||: F | F |
... talking.
   | C/E | C/E | Dm | Dm | Bb | Bb |
Oh yeah
  | C :||
I swear I heard the night ...		(Repeat and Fade Coda)
