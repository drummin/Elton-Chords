                          F#m
I hear you singing, "I Shall Be Released"
              G                                         D     A/C#
Like a chainsaw running through a masterpiece
                     Em                  G/D
But that's all right, that's ok
                 C             Bb    C    D
Grab the bottle and slide my way

                                     F#m
You dreamt of a devil down below
                    G                                  D     A/C#
Sprinkled cayenne pepper in your sugar bowl
                Em                            G/D
But he's a fool and he's a thief
        C                             Bb   C     D        G/D     D
Got silly little horns and pointed teeth
 
 
Eb                         Bb
Roll back the covers and raise the shades
Cm                        D                    Gm
We don't want to miss out on the best part of the day
Gm/F        Eb                     Bb/D                   Cm    Cm/Bb
You're my best friend you shared my crazy ways
               Ab               Eb/G                  Fm        Eb  Eb/G  Bb  Bbsus4  Bb
Now we don't want to miss out on the best part of the day
 
There's a canyon where an echo hangs
Like the ancient bells of Notre Dame
It's beyond the hills out of sight
Thought I heard 'em ringing all last night

Hear the mating call of the morning dove
Like Romeo angels in the roof above
Rains will come sweet and clean
Let the tears of God keep the mountains green
 
 
[repeat chorus]
[verse instrumental]
 
Eb                 Bb/D
One big sun coming up
Gm                       F
Old moon going down
Ab                     Eb/G
Thunder breaking in the east
                 Fm                   Eb   Eb/G  Bb   Bbsus4   Bb
I'm gonna love you 'til it comes around
 
[repeat chorus]
 
                  Eb                    Bb/D                    Cm
You're my best friend you shared my crazy ways
               Ab               Eb/G                  Fm        Eb  Eb/G  Bb  Bbsus4   Bb
Now we don't want to miss out on the best part of the day
