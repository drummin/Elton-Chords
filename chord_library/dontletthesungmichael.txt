G              C/G-G7 /B      /D      F/C  C      F/C-C
I can't light    -    no more of your darkness.
F               Bb/F-F           /A     /C         G    C/G-G  C/G-G
All my pictures    -    seem to fade to black and white.
G                 C/G-G7     /B          /D      F/C  C     F/C-C
I'm growing tired    -   and time stands still before me.
F           Bb/F-F         /A     /C     G      C/G-G   C/G-G
Frozen here    -    on the ladder of my life -
     G               C/G-G7     /B     /D        F/C  C    F/C-C
     (much) too late    -    to save myself from falling.
F               Bb/F-F       /A          /C     G  (melody B-G)
I took a chance    -    and changed your way of life.
G               C/G-G7     /B      /D     F/C  C 
But you misread    -    my meaning when I met you.
F                    /A  /C  C/G            G     F/G
Closed the door and left me blinded by the light.


CHORUS:
C                    C/Bb
Don't let the sun go down on me.
Am7                                   D7/F#
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see.
C/G                               F/G    G7            C     C/Bb
I'd just allow a fragment of your life   -   to wander free.
    F/A                           Dm  C/E   F  C/G   F/G  C  {repeat intro}
But losing everything is like the sun go - ing down  on   me.


G             C/G-G7  /B      /D      F/C    C
I can't find,    -    oh, the right romantic line.
F               Bb/F-F      /A      /C    G7
But see me once    -    and see the way I feel.
G7               /B     /D        C
Don't discard me just because you think I mean you harm.
F                                 C/G               G     F/G
But these cuts I have - they need love to help them heal.


{Repeat Chorus}
