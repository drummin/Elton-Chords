G
There was a time

      Bm	     D9      D\D#   Em  D4
I was everything and nothing all in one

	 C        G\B
When you found me

      Am			       D7
I was feeling like a cloud across the sun

 	  G
I need to tell you

	Bm		D9    D\D#    Em  D4
How you light up every second of the day

	   C	     G\B
But in the moonlight

	 Am			    D7
You just shine like a beacon on the bay


	      G
And I can't explain

         G\F# 		       Bm\F# Em  
But it's something about the way you look tonight

	         Am
Takes my breath away

				   D
It's that feeling I get about you, deep inside

		 G
And I can't describe

	 G\F#			Bm\F# Em           Em G\D C
But it's something about the way you  look tonight

C     G\B D(no 3rd)\A G  D
Takes my  breath      away

    C	    D	G        F C\E  Dm F\C  G  D
The way you look tonight


       G
With a smile

    Bm		     D9     D\D#     Em    D4
You pull the deepest secrets from my heart

       C
In all honesty

    Am				D
I'm speechless and I don't know where to start
