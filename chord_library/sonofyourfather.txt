intro: Eb

Eb                             Eb7/G
I'll catch the tramline in the morning
          Ab
With your leave Van Bushell said
       Bb7
He had further heard the cock crow
      Ab               Eb
As he stumbled out the shed

     Eb7
Then blind Joseph came towards him
       Ab
With a shotgun in his arms
               Bb
He said you'll pay me twenty dollars
      Ab                  Eb
Before you leave my farm
    Bb
Van Bushell saw the hook
      Ab                Eb
Which replaced Joseph's hand
                             Ab
He said now calm you down my brother
         Bb               Eb
Let's discuss this man to man
                 Ab
It's no good you getting angry
        Eb     G/D     Cm    Eb/Bb
We must try to act our age
          Ab            Bb
You're pursuing your convictions
          Bb          Eb
Like some hermit in a cage


           Eb          F7
You're the son of your father
Ab               Eb
Try a little bit harder
             F7              Bb7
Do for me as he would do for you
     Eb              F7
With blood and water bricks and mortar
   Ab7             Eb
He built for you a home
               Bb/D      Cm
You're the son of your father
   Ab                        Eb
So treat me as your own

Well slowly Joseph well he lowered the rifle
And he emptied out the shells
Van Bushell he came towards him
He shook his arm and wished him well
He said now hey blind man that is fine
But I sure can't waste my time
So move aside and let me go my way
I've got a train to ride
Well Joseph turned around
His grin was now a frown
He said let me just refresh your mind
Your manners boy seem hard to find (repeat chorus)

             Eb            Eb7
Well there's two men lying dead as nails
      Ab
On an East Virginia farm
        Bb
For charity's an argument
     Ab            Eb
That only leads to harm
                           Eb7
So be careful when they're kind to you
          Ab7
Don't you end up in the dirt
       Bb7
Just remember what I'm saying to you
        Ab               Eb      (repeat chorus again)
And you likely won't get hurt
