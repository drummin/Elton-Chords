Oh little jeannie
           F/A       Gm
you got so much love

little jeannie
        Ab/Eb            Eb
and you take it where it strikes
    Bb/F           C/G          F/A
and give it to the likes of me

oh little jeannie
she got so much love
little jeannie
but you're burning it up so fast
your searching for some lasting truth

      Ab/Eb       Eb       Bb
and i want you to be my acrobat
  Ab/Eb       Eb    Bb
i want you to be my lover
         F/A   Gm     F                         C/E
oh there where others who would treat you cruel
           (3rd time) and ive known quite of  few
    Eb       Eb/F
and oh jeannie you were always someones fool 

(repeat verse chords for second verse, after second chorus
play verse chors again as instrumental solo - after third time
go to coda)

oh little jeannie
you got so much time
little jeannie
though youve grown beyond your years
you still retain the fears of youth

oh little jeannie
you got so much time
litlle jeannie 
but your burning it up so fast
searching for some lasting truth (to chorus)

Bb                             F/A
you steped into my life from a bad dream
                       Gm                          Dm7
making the life that i had seem suddenly shiny and new
       Eb     Eb/F
oh jeannie im so in love with you
