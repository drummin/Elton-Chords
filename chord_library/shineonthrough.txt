Eb        Bb\Eb
Oh my love

       Ab                  Eb
I have cursed the stars above

     Bb       F\A        Bb  Bb Fm\Ab
That lead my heart to you

Eb\G               Ab
But as hard as I try

         Bb   G\B      Cm  Abm
Still my love will not die

          Eb          Bb       Eb    Bb\D Eb
And the stars still shine on through

          Eb          Bb        Ab   Eb
And the stars still shine on through


Eb     Bb
Oh my dear

         Ab                   Eb
Now this ship's too hard to steer

     Bb       F\A               Bb  Bb Fm
The tide has turned, turned on you

       Eb\G              Ab
I have been through the lies

     Bb        G\B     Cm   Abm
That I've seen in your eyes

          Eb          Bb         Cm   Bb\D Eb
But the truth still shines on through

          Eb             Bb                 Ab   Eb
But the truth it still shines, shines on through


Db Ab             Ab  Bb        Eb              Eb
So shine, shine on through the days we have to fill

Eb     Bb\D Cm          Bb Ab
Though we took our love so daringly

Bb          G\B   Cm
And gave it up uncaringly

           F7               Fm          Bb    Bb  Ab
There are feelings left not even we can kill  Oh_____!


Eb Eb   Bb
Oh my friend

      Ab                Eb
So at last we reach the end

    Bb        F\A     Bb  Bb Fm
The lights go down on cue

        Eb\G      Ab
I have wasted my time

        Bb    G\B    Cm  Abm
But it tasted oh so fine

        Eb         Bb                   Cm   Bb\D  Eb
That my love still shines, shines on through

        Ab          Bb               Ab  Eb\G
And my love still shines, shines on you
  
    Ab  Bb
On you

Ab  Eb
