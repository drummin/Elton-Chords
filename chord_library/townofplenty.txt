Bb             Eb            Ab        Bb  Eb Ab
I don't belong looking for a town of plenty

Eb
There weren't these thieves

We had some thing in common

Eb 
Goals to achieve

Can't you see it, this is not my writing

Bb           Eb            Ab      Bb    Eb Ab
I only asked if this was a town of plenty

Eb
There were many archives

Ab        Bb
We had no media

Eb
Only art survived there

Ab             Bb
Yeah we had no media

    Bb Eb\C Bb\D

In a town of plenty

And laid across the airstrip

         Ab                Bb
Were the passports and the luggage

Ab
All that once remained

     Ab          Bb
Of a rugged individual

    Ab 
And laid across the airstrip

         Ab                Bb
Were the passports and the luggage

    Bb Eb\C Bb\D
And oh__________!
