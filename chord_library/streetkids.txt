Dm             
They must have had the whole thing planned

Dm Dm\C Dm\B            Dm\A   Am G Am G  Am G Am G
        There must have been a hundred

Dm
If we make a stand

Dm Dm\C Dm\B         Dm\A  Am G Am G  Am G Am G
       I think we'll be outnumbered

Dm                  
If I'd had the chance

Dm Dm\C Dm\B   Dm\A  Am G Am G  Am G Am G
        Then I could understand

Dm
Why I'm a juvenile delinquent

Dm Dm\C Dm\B   Dm\A Am  G   Am G  Am G Am G
             In an East End gang


Dm                                    C
And if you think you've seen gasoline burning in my eyes

Am        G       Am        G        Am      G        Am      G    Dm
Don't be alarmed, tell yourself it's good to be, it's good to be alive

Dm  C  Am\G*  Dm C Dm


Bm  				     E
It's just another street kid on your tail

F7
Running on the wrong side of the rails

        Bm		     E
With my boot lace tie and my hand-me-downs

         Am                                     G
You know I run the toughest bunch this side of town

      F7\G                                     Dm  C  Am\G*  Dm C Dm
Those street kids making news just being around

Dm  C  Am\G*  Dm C Dm


Dm       
I've been bottled and been brained

Dm Dm\C Dm\B      Dm\A     Am G Am G  Am G Am G
        Squealers can't be trusted

Dm
If we fight tonight

Dm Dm\C    Dm\B      Dm\A   Am G Am G  Am G Am G
   You can bet we'll all be busted

Dm
I'd like to break away

Dm Dm\C Dm\B   Dm\A Am  G   Am G  Am G Am G
           From the rut I'm in

Dm
But beggars can't be choosers

Dm Dm\C Dm\B   Dm\A   Am  G   Am G  Am G Am G
            And I was born to sin

Dm                                    C
And if you think you've seen gasoline burning in my eyes

Am        G       Am        G        Am      G        Am      G    Dm
Don't be alarmed, tell yourself it's good to be, it's good to be alive

Dm  C  Am\G*  Dm C Dm

         Am                                     G

      F7\G                                     Dm  C 
Those street kids making news just being around


                      Am\G*
Let's hear it for the street kids

                             Dm Dm  C  Dm
Making news just being around

(INSTRUMENTAL VERSE)

(CHORUS)

                    Am\G*
Let's hear it for the street kids

                             Dm Dm  C  Dm
Making news just being around


Dm 
Just another street kid,

            C
Just another street kid,

             Am\G				       Dm Dm  C  Dm
Just another street kid, making news just being around.
