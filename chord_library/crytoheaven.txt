Am  F  Am  F

	  Am		     F            G
I found a black beret on the street today

       Am
It was lying in the gutter all torn

          C\G        F                G
There's a white flag flying on a tall building

        E9\G#		         E
But the kids just watch the storm


	    Am			 F	G
Their dirty faces pressed on the windows

	  Am
Shattered glass before their eyes

	  C\G	  F			  G
There's a mad dog barking in a burned out subway

          E9\G#		        E
Where the sniper sleeps at night


	    Am	 	   F
No birthday songs to sing again

		G      E7\G#   Am
Just bricks and stones to give them

C\G	  F		      G
Wrap them up in your father's flags

		    E\G#   E
And let them cry to heaven


	    Am	 	   F
No birthday songs to sing again

		G      E7\G#   Am
Just bricks and stones to give them

C\G	  F		      G
Wrap them up in your father's flags

		    E\G#   E
And let them cry to heaven


	  Am		   F
There are many graves by a cold lake

       G		   Am
As the beds were when your babies are born

         C\G	  F			G
And your rag doll sits with a permanent grin

        E9\G# 		    E
But the kids just watch the storm


	Am		  F	      G
I saw a black cat tease a white mouse

	 Am
Until he killed it with his claws

	C\G    F		G
Seems a lot of countries do the same thing

E9\G#		  E
Before they go to war

(CHORUS)

                Am     F
Let them cry to heaven

                Am     F
Let them cry to heaven

         G      Am
Let them cry to heaven
