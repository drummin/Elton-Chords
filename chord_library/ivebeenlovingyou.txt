I didn't mean to hurt you

Those things that I said yesterday

Eb                         Eb  Bb\D 
Were things I shouldn't say

Cm              F
Although you're blue

         Bb      F\A         Gm  Bb\F
Just one thing I want you to do

        Eb          
Just forget all those things

       Eb    Em   F
That I said about you

`Cause I've been loving you baby

Bb\A                  Eb       Eb Bb\D
Loving you baby for a long time

       Cm         Bb
And if you go away

I just won't know what to do

Oh___________ no no no no

So don't you feel sad

It's not the thing to do

Bb        F\A
Because I worry

     Eb                      Eb  Bb\D
If I know you're feeling blue

Please put your tears away

So nobody can see

           Eb    
`Cause the last thing I want

              Eb  Em   F  F Bb\F F
Is for you to cry over me
