Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly-a girl w/ kaleidoscope eyes.
Ab                    Bb9              Cm/Eb               Ab
Cellophane flowers of yellow and green towering over your head.
Bb9                         F                         C
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes and she's gone.

Lucy in the sky with diamonds.  Lucy in the sky with diamonds.

Lucy in the sky with diamonds.  Ohhh


  

G          G/F       C/E         Cm/Eb
Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain -
      G/D           G/F        C/E         Cm/Eb   Eb-F/C
where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies.

Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers that grow so incredibly high.
Ab                Bb9               Cm/Eb                Ab
Newspaper taxis appear on the shore waiting to take you away.
Bb9                         F                              C
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds and you're gone.

Picture yourself on a train in a station -

with plasticine porters with looking glass ties.
