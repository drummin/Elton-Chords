"The Last Song"
Music By: Elton John
Words By; Bernie Taupin

Here is the song in C Major. I have seen many versions that transpose it up a half step.

INTRO:
C  Am  F  G

VERSE 1:
C                     Am
Yesterday you came to lift me up
   F                                  C
As light as straw and brittle as a bird
  Dm                      Am
Today I weigh less than a shadow on the wall
              G            G     Am7   G/B
Just one more whisper of a voice unheard

VERSE 2:
Tomorrow leave the windows open
As fear grows please hold me in your arms
Won't you help me if you can to shake this anger?
I need your gentle hands to keep me calm

CHORUS:
         C
'Cause I never thought I'd lose
  G/B
I only thought I'd win
  Am
I never dreamed I'd feel
     Em/G
This fire beneath my skin
                    F
I can't believe you love me
                      C     Am
I never thought you'd come
                    C/G
I guess I misjudged love
          F/G    C/G  G  C
Between a father and his son

BRIDGE:
C  Am  F  G

VERSE 3:
Things we never said come together
The hidden truth no longer haunting me
Tonight we touched on the things that were never spoken
That kind of understanding sets me free

CHORUS
