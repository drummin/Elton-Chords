       {play twice}


Eb          F/Eb     Dm7           Gm7    Bb/F
You've been crying,        and I'm crazy about you.
Eb        F/Eb    Dm7      Gm
I've been lying,       and hanging you up, `cause -
Abmaj7          Bb/Ab   Gm7       Cm          Cm/Bb
I'm deep on the inside,      but flash on the outside.
Abmaj7          Bb/Ab     Gm7      Cm
       I am the thunder,       and you are my lightning.




CHORUS:
F9                        G7+5                    Cm7
Give me the love, babe.   Give me the key to your heart.
            F9            G7+5                    Cm7
Give me the love, babe.   Give me the key to your heart.
            F9      G7+5                     Cm    {play intro once}
Give me the love.   Give me the key to your heart.


Eb        F/Eb      Dm7      Gm7      Bb/F
Months of watching,      and hours of hoping -
Eb              F/Eb     Dm7           Gm
     that you'd want me,      when you see me again.
Abmaj7      Bb/Ab  Gm7        Cm        Cm/Bb
For I am an eagle,     but my wings are all tied up.
Abmaj7             Bb/Ab   Gm7     Cm
       You got the power        to fly me again.



Eb          F/Eb    Dm7           Gm7        Bb/F
You've been trying   -   to build walls all around you.
Eb         F/Eb   Dm7             Gm
But you're lying,     `cause I've already been through.
Abmaj7            Bb/Ab   Gm7     Cm           Cm/Bb
And I've seen you trying   -   to capture that feeling.
Abmaj7            Bb/Ab    Gm7              Cm
       But you're chasing   -   what you've never believed in.


Bb               Cm (play intro, end in Bb)             Cm
     Tell me you love me.                   Tell me you need me.
