Peter's Song
(B-Side "Turn Out the Lights When You Leave")

Intro: Am    F    D  C   Bm

Am  F  D  F  G

A                    E/G#
I'll bring you peace I'll give you love

G          D                        A
Be part of all your dreams while growing up

Bm               F#m
It's hard enough just holding on

      D                                 E
To secrets that you keep before they're here and gone




A                E/G#
So short of time Where does it go

G              D                        A
That chance to reach a world beyond the fields we know

Bm                   F#m
Like shooting stars, we burn a path

D                                E
Comets on the run, we see our childhood pass


chorus:
         F#                           Bm
And all around the sound of children laughing

D/A                Esus4   E
Sons and daughters dan-----cing

                A              C#
Fingertips that turn the magic key

     F#                  Bm               F#m/A
To wonder and adventure, growing up comes later

       E                                Am   F    D C  Bm
Right now that world belongs to you and me

Am       F          D          F          G


I'll give you hope, I'll dry your tears
Make sure our magic moments never disappear
We'll ring those bells, we'll beat the drum
And conjure up a world where we can still belong

Times like these, they're gone too soon
Swifter than an echo bouncing off the moon
We'll be OK if we believe
That every breath we take becomes a memory


        F#                             Bm
And all around the sound of children laughing

D/A                Esus4   E
Sons and daughters dan-----cing

                A              C#
Fingertips that turn the magic key

     F#                  Bm               F#m/A
To wonder and adventure, growing up comes later

      E                                 Am C#
Right now that world belongs to you and me



         F#                           Bm
And all around the sound of children laughing

D/A                Esus4   E
Sons and daughters dan-----cing

                A              C#
Fingertips that turn the magic key

     F#                  Bm               F#m/A
To wonder and adventure, growing up comes later

       E                                Am F
Right now that world belongs to you and me




      D                 E               Am     F
Right now this world belongs to you and me

      D                E                Am     F
Right now this world belongs to you and me


D          C          F          G          A
