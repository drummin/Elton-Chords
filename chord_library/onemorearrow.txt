Eb Bb\D Ab\C  Eb Bb\D Ab\C  Bb\D

		  Eb
He said I want to grow up

	             Ab
And look like Robert Mitchum

			 Fm
And I hope that when I'm gone

			    Bb       Ab
There'll be some say that I miss him

		    Eb
He must have been romantic

		      Ab
He must have sensed adventure

			Fm  Ab7+\F
And I feel the steel of his strong will

			Bb      Ab
In the frame around his picture


	 Ab9\Eb   Eb    Ab9\Eb Ab      Eb
And he's one more arrow flying through the air

Ab9      Ab            Eb\G       Cm
One more arrow landing in a shady spot somewhere

	  Dm		  Eb 
Where the days and nights blend into one

    Em  	  Fm
And he can always feel the sun

	    Ab		
Through the soft brown earth that holds him 

Bb	       Eb
Forever always young

Eb Bb\D Ab\C  Bb\D


		     Eb
He could have been a boxer

	 		     Ab
But the fight game seemed so dirty

                  Fm      Ab7+\F   
We argued once he knocked me down

				  Bb      Ab
And he cried when he thought he'd hurt me

		  Eb
Strictly from the old school

		       Ab
He was quiet about his pain

       Ab     Cm\G      Fm Ab7+\F
And if one in ten could be that brave

	  	   Bb    Ab
I would never hate again

(CHORUS)

Eb  Bb\D Ab\C
One more arrow

Eb  Bb\D Ab\C
One more arrow

Eb  Bb\D Ab\C
One more arrow

   Bb          Eb
Forever always young
