"Where To Now St Peter"
Music By: Elton John
Words By; Bernie Taupin


intro: B-Bm7-E-B-B-Bm7-E-B

B                A   G E      B
i took my self a blue   canoe
      D       A      E        B
and i floated like a leaf
B                A   G E          B
dazzling dancing half   enchanted
D     A      E
in my merlin sleep
G     A          Bm
crazy was the feeling
G        A       Bm
restless were my eyes
G           A        E
insane they took the padles
G                F#sus4  F#
my arms they paralyzed


(Chorus)
Bm          C
so where to now st. peter
E                 G
if its true im in your hands
Bm        D
i may not be a christian
E                    G
but ive done all one man can
Bm                     D
i understand im on the road
      E                    G
where all that was is gone
   Bm       D             Esus4
so where to now st. peter
G             A           Esus4
show me which road im on
Esus4         B
which road im on


B-Bm7-E-B-B-Bm7-E-B (to coda last time)


B                    A      G E    B
i took a sweet young foreign   gun
     D    A       E                B
this lazy life is short
B                     A     G E    B
something for nothing always   ended
D      A     E                     B
with a bad report
G     A           Bm
dirty was the day break
G      A       Bm
sudden was the change
G       A        E
in such a silent place is this
G                 F#sus4          F#
beyond the riffle range (To Chorus)


Coda:
B                A   G E     B
i took my self a blue   canoe
