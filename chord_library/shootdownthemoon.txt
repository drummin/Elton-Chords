intro:
C  F/C  G  F/C  C  F/C

C             F/C
Oh no I don't want it
G/C             C
You can take it all
                           G/B
I'll put my money where my mouth is
Fm/Ab                    Am
Put your suitcase in the hall
A7               Dm
Oh you robbed me blind
E7-9                  Am      Dm
Of what little hope remained
Am        Bb7
You put a gun to my head
  E7                Am
A bullet through my brain

                         Bm7
You can't shoot down the moon
G                 Am         Dm
Some things never change
A7                       B7
We can build a bridge between us
                    Em
But the empty space remains
E7                       Bm7-5
You can't shoot down the moon
E7                Am          Dm
Some things never change
Am                      Bb7
We can build a bridge between us
        E7            A7          G7 (Am)
But the empty space remains


Just as long as you're around
We live on borrowed time
I'll put my money where my mouth is
You're guilty at the scene of the crime
I never say more than I need
The mystery runs deep
The dangers buried below
The secrets that you keep

                         Bm7
You can't shoot down the moon
G                 Am         Dm
Some things never change
A7                       B7
We can build a bridge between us
                    Em
But the empty space remains
E7                       Bm7-5
You can't shoot down the moon
E7                Am          Dm
Some things never change
Am                      Bb7
We can build a bridge between us
        E7            A7          Am
But the empty space remains

break:
Dm  Am  Dm  Am  Dm  Am
