Holliday Inn
Music: Elton John
Lyrics: Bernie Taupin
Album: Madman Across The Water

E                      D                      A  D/A  A  D/A
Boston at last and the plane's touching down
    E                      D          A       D/A  A  D/A
Our hostess is handing the hot towels around
       F#m                C#m        Bm      Bmsus4
From a terminal gate to a black limousine
       E                      D            A  D/A  A
It's a ten minute ride to the Holiday Inn


Boredom's a pastime that one soon acquired
Where you get to the stage where you're not even tired
Kicking your heels till the time comes around
To pick up your bags and head out of town

G         D                        A      D/A  D  D/A  A
Slow down Joe, I'm a rock and roll man
     G           D                            A  D/A  A  D/A   A
I've twiddled my thumbs in a dozen odd bands
D                          E7
And you ain't seen nothing till you've been
     F#m       D                       A   G    F#m    D7sus4    D7    A
In a motel baby like the Holiday Inn

repeat verse chords as instrumental and then repeat chorus

outro:  A  G  Fm#  D7sus4  D7
