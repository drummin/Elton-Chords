Is there anything left, Maybe steak and eggs

Waking up to washing up

Making up your bed
Cm Gm/Bb  F/A     F6/A F/A   Eb/G          Cm7           Bb  
Lazy      days my  razor     blade, Could use a better edge

It's enough to make you laugh, Relax in a nice cool bath

Inspiration for navigation
			Cm
Of our new found craft
Cm Gm/Bb  F/A     F6/A F/A   Eb/G        Cm7            Bb 
I  know   you and you  know   me, It's always half and half

Chorus:
A7			 Dm
And we were oh oh, so you know
G7               C
Not the kind to dawdle
Bm7                E7
Will the things we wrote today
A        E7/B  Ab/C  A/C#
Sound as good tomorrow
Dm7                 G7
We will still be writing
Cmaj7             Am
In approaching years
Bm7               E7
Stifling yawns on Sundays
        A       E7/B  A/C#
As the weekends disappear

Bbsus2
We could stretch our legs if we'd half a mind
But don't disturb us if you hear us trying
      Fm6/Ab	              G7            Cm
To instigate the structure of another line or two
       Cm        Gm/Bb  F/A     
Cause writing's lighting up
       F6/A F/A   Eb/G                (Repeat intro out)
And I like life enough to see it through
