[Verse 1]
    G                Em           C
You say that all you want are the simple things
     D               C  G                  F
Long walks on lonely beaches, guitars with nylon strings
         C                  D                      Em     C  D
But underneath you'd rather leap through a hoop of fire
         G                  Em                 C
You shy away from lips that want, that want to kiss you
       D              C   G                    F
Tongue-tied on formal evenings, wealth don't impress you
           C                   D                 G
But if you ask me you like the heat in a hoop of fire
 
 
[Chorus]
                           D               C                  G     Gsus4  G
And it's hard to read just how you feel or what your dreams desire
                      C              D                    G     Em
Your pulse that races when I'm close reads like a hoop of fire
                      C              D                    G     Em
Your pulse that races when I'm close reads like a hoop of fire

[Verse 2]
              G       Em             C
No late nights making love in secret places
         D             G                      F
You feel pressure all around you, mistrust in strangers faces
             C                            D                 G    Gsus4  G
But don't pretend you wouldn't spend some time in a hoop of fire
 
 
[Chorus]
                           D               C                  G    Gsus4  G
And it's hard to read just how you feel or what your dreams desire
                      C              D                    G     Em
Your pulse that races when I'm close reads like a hoop of fire
                      C              D                    G     Em
Your pulse that races when I'm close reads like a hoop of fire

Your pulse that races when I'm close reads like a hoop of fire (Hoop of fire)

Your pulse that races when I'm close reads like a hoop of fire (Hoop of fire)
