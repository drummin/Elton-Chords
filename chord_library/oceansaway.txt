VERSE 1

  EB                Eb9               Ab                Eb
I hung out with the old folks, in the hope that I'd get wise.

      Gm                   Cm               F       Bb
I was trying to bridge the gap, between the great divide.

        Eb        Eb9              Ab               Eb
Hung on every recollection, in the theatre of their eyes

        Gm             Cm           F                 Bb
Picking up on this and that, in the few that still survive.


CHORUS

        Eb
Call em up

        Cm
Dust em off

D      Gm
Let em shine

    Ab              Eb                F              Bb
The ones who hold onto the ones, they had to leave behind

           Eb               Cm
Those that flew, those that fell,

    D                Gm
The ones that had to stay,

          Ab            Eb
Beneath a little wooden cross

 Bb     EB
Oceans away


REPEAT INTRO


VERSE 2 (SAME CHORDS AS VERSE 1)

They bend like trees in winter, these shuffling old gray lions
Though snow white start to gather, like the belt around Orion.
Just a touch of faded lightning, of the powerful design,
Of the generation gathered, for maybe the last time.


REPEAT CHORUS


BRIDGE

F#                                              Ab                                         Bbm
Oceans away where the green grass sways and the cool wind blows across the shadow of their graves.

F#                                     AB
shoulder to shoulder, back in the day, sleeping bones to rest in Earth

Bbm Fsus4  Bbm
O - ceans away

F#  Ab     Bb
O - ceans away
