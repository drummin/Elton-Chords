intro: E  Esus4  E  Aadd9  Add9sus4  Add9  C  G  D (repeat)

E                      Add9  E                   B      E
We've been crippled in love, short changed, hung out to dry
E                    Aadd9   E                   B7sus4  B7
We've chalked on the walls a slogan or two about life
      Aadd9                     Add9sus4       Aadd9 E      Aadd9
Stood dazed in the doorway, the king and queen of    clowns
E          Aadd9                     Cm#                B7sus4  B7
We've been flipped like a coin, both of us landing face-down

   Em      G#m     Aadd9                E
So please, please, let me grow old with you
      G#m                   C#m                     E/B   B
After everything we've been through, what's left to prove
   Aadd9   C       E          Aadd9  E  B
so please, please, please, oh please    let me grow old with you


repeat intro here


We've been living with sorrow, been up, down and all around
We've buried our feelings a little too deep in the ground
Stood dazed in the doorway, the king and queen of clowns
We've been flipped like a coin, both of us landing face-down


    C#m                         G#7
But tied to the same track, the two of us look back
   Aadd9            E
At oncoming trains ahead
G#m                        C#m
How many more times can we lay on the line
             D    B7
Watching our love hang by a thread


   Aadd9   C       E          Aadd9  E  B
so please, please, please, oh please    let me grow old with you
