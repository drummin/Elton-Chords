Intro:
Am (c b a b g a a octave) Am/Dm (d e f g a b c a b) 2x
 
Am    D/Am
Freedom for the scapegoat leaving Reading Gaol
Am
Rheumy eyes just pierced his heart like
D/Am
Crucifixion nails
Am
Shaking fists and razors gleamed, you never
D/Am
stood a chance
Am    G    F    E
When the ink ran red on Fleet Street, you turned
Am
your eyes to France

(Intro)

Am
Humbled far
D/Am
from Dublin, chased across the waves
Am
Your biting wit still sharp enough to slice through
D/Am
every page
Am    D/Am
Destitute and beaten by the system of the crown
Am    G    F    E
The bitter pill you swallow tasted sweeter going
Am
down
 
chorus:
Dm    E    Am
And looking back on the great indifference
Dm    E    Am
Looking back at the limestone walls
Am/D    E    Am
Thinking how beauty deceived you
D     E
Knowing how love fools us all
 
Intro 2x
 
A golden boy in velveteen landed in New York
The past was so seductive when the paid to hear you talk
Baccarat and champagne flutes, tobacco from Virginia
Long before the lords and law branded Oscar Wilde a sinner
 
chorus:
And looking back on the cold bleak winter
Looking back on those long dark days
Felt like the head of John the Baptist
In the arms of Salome

Am
Don't turn around it's a while gull screaming
D/Am
Don't cry out loud you never know who's listening
F    C    G
You've seen it all the exiled Unforgiven
Dm    E    Am
From the stately homes of England to her prisons
Am
And looking back at the hardened lifers
D/Am
Looking back on the wretched poor
F    C    G
Thinking maybe they were my saviors
Dm    E    Am
Strange to think I'll miss them all
Dm    E    Am
Strange to think I'll miss them all
