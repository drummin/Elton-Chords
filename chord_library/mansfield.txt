Mansfield 
Music by Elton John
Lyrics by Bernie Taupin
Available on the album Songs From The West Coast

F/A    Bb    F    C/G   C    D
F/A    Bb    F    C/G   C    D

       A                D/A      A
It's a case I guess of paradise lost
G                     Bm/F#
Ten years back on the hands of the clock
          C                    G
In that little house on Mansfield
             D
On your old block
F#m                        G                  D               
Sometimes the magic of the past is all we've got

Just you and me at a crossroads then
Ain't it funny how we were old friends
Accidentally thrown together
Did we intend
To be the romantic novel you never want to end

              G/B                            C
And it's the contact of the eye that meets across a crowded room
      G                          D
And how I kind of wound up the lyrics to your tune
            G/B                          C                D
You said, 'Funny but it feels like I've known you all my life
    F/A         Bb       F       C/G     C       D
And how it might feel to kiss you on the mouth tonight'

      Eb              Bb/D            Cm7       Bb
In between the Star of David and the California moon
       Eb                           Bb/D                F
The Santa Ana winds blew warm into your room
              Eb                    Bb/D
We were crazy, wild and running
                  Cm7        Bb
Blind to the change to come
          Cm7                 D7
In that little house on Mansfield
    Gsus4-Gm Eb           Bb    F
We'd wake at the break of dawn
     Gsus4-Gm  Eb   F       G
In an Indian summer gone

In the candlelight I can recall
Your naked shadow looking ten feet tall
Like a wild pony dancing
Along the wall
Off balance I found love the only place to fall
 
  Gsus4-Gm Eb             Bb    F
We'd wake at the break of dawn
    Gsus4-Gm Eb     F       G
In an Indian summer gone
