Love Lies Bleeding
Music by Elton John
Lyrics by Bernie Taupin
Available on the album Goodbye Yellow Brick Road (1973)

[Intro (where each || represents one measure of 4/4)]:
| A | C | G | F  G  G#dim | A | C | G | F  G |

    A
The roses in the window box
            E               E/D
Have tilted to one side
A/C#           D
Everything about this house
            Bm               B
Was born to grow and die

         A                      F#m
Oh it doesn't seem a year ago
              Bm
To this very day
              A
You said I'm sorry honey
     E
If I don't change the pace
  D                           F#m
I can't face another day

[Chorus]:
                 Bm               E  Bm7  Bm7/E  E  Bm7/E  E
And love lies bleeding in my hand
       F#m                    Bm                E  Bm7  E  Bm7  E
Oh it kills me to think of you with another man
       A                                 Bm7
I was playing rock and roll and you were just a fan
          A/C#
But my guitar couldn't hold you
      D                Am  Am/D  Am  F#m
So I split the band
          E                    A
Love lies bleeding in my hand

| C | C/G G | F G G#m | A | C | G | F | G |
                               ^^^ Last time to Coda after this bar

I wonder if those changes
Have left a scar on you
Like all the burning hoops of fire
That you and I passed through

You're a bluebird on a telegraph line
I hope you're happy now
Well if the wind of change comes down your way girl
You'll make it back somehow

[Chorus]

Instrumental bit:
| C | C/G G | F G G#m | A | C | G | F | G | A5 | C | G | F | A | C | G | F | A |
||: C | G | F | A :|| (repeat 3x)
| A | C | C/G G | F | G | A | C | C/G G | F | G |

[Chorus] (to Coda at the end)

Coda:
||:  F  G  :|| (repeat and fade instrumental)
