Intro: |  F  |  C  |  Dm  |  F/C - C   C  |


F                      C
Look up little brother - can you see the clover?
Dm          Dm7    G              Eb            C
No not over there.   A little bit left and over there.
F                                 C
Now look and see the lilac tree - the lily pond, the skylark's song.
Dm                      Dm7    G                       Eb      C
The open air but no one cares  -  if branches live and die out there.



CHORUS:
Am            Dm                Am
Remember when you were nine and I was ten.
               Dm              Ebmaj7                    D7sus   D7
We would run into the woods.   Now we never will again.
    G                                D/F#
And Lady, what's tomorrow - what's tomorrow anyway?
        Em              Bm            C             D7
If it's not the same as now, it's the same as yesterday.
    G                                D/F#
Yes Lady, what's tomorrow?   Will it be the same as now?
         Em              Bm              C               D7
Will the farmer push the pen?   Will the writer pull the plough?



F                      C
Look up little brother - can you see the clover?
Dm                  Dm7   G                 Eb            C
Oh sorry - but it's over.    Now there's concrete and no clover.



{Repeat Chorus}


      C     D7                | G  D/F# | Em  Em/D | C | D7 | G | / |
Coda:    Oh lady, what's to  -  mor  -    row?
