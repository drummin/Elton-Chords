D  C\E  D7\F#

(G  Em  C  D7\F#)*

     G
I remember when rock was young

D\F#   Em 
Me and Suzie had so much fun

   D+3   C
holding hands and skimming stones

C\C#   D
Had an old gold Chevy and a place of my own

	G
But the biggest kick I ever got

    D\F#    Em
was doing a thing called the Crocodile Rock

D+3       C
While the other kids were Rocking Round the Clock

   C\C#  D
we were hopping and bopping to the Crocodile Rock


     Em        G\D Em  G\D Em  G\D   Em
Well Crocodile Rocking is  something shocking

          C7        C
when your feet just can't keep still

D				    G	
I never knew me a better time and I guess I never will

Em
Oh Lawdy mama those Friday nights

     C		    C7
when Suzie wore her dresses tight

        D		      G\D    F C F C   F C
and the Crocodile Rocking was out of si____ght

G     G     D\F#    Em
Laaa  la la la la laaa

Em    D+3   C
la la la la laaa

C     C\C#  D
la la la la laaa


	G				     D\F#
But the years went by and the rock just died

Em					Em  D+3
Suzie went and left us for some foreign guy

C				        C\C#
Long nights crying by the record machine

D
dreaming of my Chevy and my old blue jeans

	    G
But they'll never kill the thrills we've got

D\F#    Em
burning up to the Crocodile Rock

D+3	 C
Learning fast as the weeks went past

   C\C#	  D
we really thought the Crocodile Rock would last

(CHORUS)

     G
I remember when rock was young

D\F#   Em 
Me and Suzie had so much fun

   D+3   C
holding hands and skimming stones

C\C#   D
Had an old gold Chevy and a place of my own

	G
But the biggest kick I ever got

    D\F#    Em
was doing a thing called the Crocodile Rock

D+3       C
While the other kids were Rocking Round the Clock

   C\C#  D
we were hopping and bopping to the Crocodile Rock

(CHORUS)

G     G     D\F#    Em
Laaa  la la la la laaa

Em    D+3   C
la la la la laaa

C     C\C#  D
la la la la laaa
(REPEAT, FADE)
