Words By; Bernie Taupin

intro:F Gm F/A | Eb Bb Eb F repeat | 

F                       Bb           F
Like a thief he's come, like a thief he's gone
F                G7           Gm     Bb/C
He's stolen your tears one by one
F                         Bb             G7
You're proud to love him, it's a foolish sign
A               Dm           Bb    F/A Gm7 F     play intro here
You're a broken heart at the scene of  the crime
F                       Bb
And the night drags on, and the fever burns
F               G7        Gm7        Bb/C
Come to your senses, everybody learns
F                       Bb       G7
You sleep in sweet fire lost and blue
A               Dm          Bb    F/A  Gm7 F
You're an empty doll in the power of   a   fool


Bb       F
Don't go sleeping with the past
      Eb Bb                 F
Don't go praying he'll come back
       Dm              Dm7
Take a deep breath and deny
          G               C
You could love a man like that
C7       F
Don't go sleeping with the past
         Bb            F
Don't go waking with a dream
           Dm  
There's no tenderness that's left
       G7     Bb/C        F
In the cracks you step between


F                      Bb             F
If it looks like rain, if it makes no sound
F                              G7      Bb/C
It's an echo of pain on common ground
F                     Bb
Love's like a junkie, addiction's a fact
A           Dm         Bb    F/A  Gm7 F
Passion's a monkey you can't keep off your back

A7                                Dm
But he takes love and he turns it cold
A7                                               Dm
He's just an iceman honey, ain't got no heart of gold
Dm                     F/A                     
But he sees you and he runs from you
        Gm7                        Dm7  
Come on and shake this shadow that you're clinging to
          Bb
And he'll hurt you
          F/A
And he'll run from you
        Gm9                
Come on and shake this shadow that you're clinging to
