Intro: (repeat 4 times) E  A/E

E         A/E               E    A E
 Look out new world here we come

 Brave, intrepid    and then some

 F#m
 Pioneers of maximum

 A6
 Audacity whose resumes

 C# no 3rd add 4th
 Show that we are just the team

 F#nat
 To live where others merely dream

 A                           B
 Building up a head of steam

                 E     A/E   E   E
 On the trail we blaze


           F
 Changing legend into fact

           Am  G/A  Am
 We shall ride into history

         F
 Turning myth into truth

          Am  G/A Am   
 We shall surely gaze

        Dm
 On the sweet unfolding

       Em  Em4th Am 
 Of an antique mystery

 Dnat
 All will be revealed

        G    Am/G G    b g d g d b g (single notes)
 On the trail we blaze


    E A/E E A/E

Paradise is close at hand
Shangri-la the promised land
Seventh heaven on demand
Quite unusual nowadays
Virgin vistas, undefiled
Minds and bodies running wild
In the man behold the child
On the trail we blaze

The trail we blaze
Is a road uncharted
Through terra incognita to a golden shrine
No place for the traveler
To be faint-hearted
We are part of the sumptuous grand design

Hold extra 2 beats b g d g d b g
