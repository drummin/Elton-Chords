Intro:  |  E  |  E  D/E  |  E  |  E  D/E  |


D                   A       E
I'm not a rat to be spat on locked up in this room.
D                       A               E
Those bars that look towards the sun at night look towards the moon.
G            A                    E
Everyday the swallows play in the clouds of love.
G                 F#m                 B
Make me wish that I had wings take me high above.


CHORUS:
Am7           G    D                    A
And I looked high  -  and saw the empty sky.
Am7        G     D              A
If I could only,   I could only fly.
G              D/F#             A/E     A
I'd drift with them in endless space.
G          D/F#             E
But no man flies from this place.



   D            A                E
At night I lay upon my bench and stare towards the stars.
    D                    A               E
The cold night air comes creeping in and home seems oh so far.
   G            A                E
If only I could swing upon those twinkling dots above.
    G                  F#m      B
I'd look down from the heavens upon the ones I love.

{Repeat Chorus}

D               A             E
Hey - the lucky locket hangs around your precious neck.
D                A                   E
Some luck I ever got with you and I  -  wouldn't like to bet -
G                           A            E
that sooner or later you'll own just one half of this land.
   G            F#m         B
By shining your eyes on the wealth of every man.


D   D/A       A     E      D   A          E
    Just send up my love.     Ain't seen nothing but tears.
D   A         E           D   A       E
    Now I've got myself   -   in this room for years.
D   A         E          D A         E
    Don't see no one one,  Never see anyone
D   A          E           D   A       E
    Yeah we're high, yeah
