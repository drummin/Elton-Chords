Well I'm keeping off the streets        -  since you came to town.
 G    Am   G/B    C  G/B - Am - G     D/F#                     C/D - D7
Since you claimed my heart          - from the lost and found.
G  Am  G/B  C   G/B   Am   G   C     G/B      Am
I - I - I  have said 'goodbye' to my foolin' around.

Be the king              of   the hill - in my neighborhood.
G - Am - G/B - C  G/B  Am   G    C  G/B           Am
Rain              on   my  roof  -  what a sweet sound.

With you underneath it's like can - dy   by the pound.


        C     
You can tell everybody that this girl of mine -
    G
is sweeter than the grapes hanging from the vine.
C
Love like wine honey drinking till I drown.
D                        Am    G/B  C  C/D  G
Keep it coming baby like can - dy   by the pound.


   C                             G
Oh no, what's come over me?   If I am dreaming then let me sleep.
C                          D                            Am    G/B  C  
C/D  G
Oh wow - I'm heaven bound. Love is getting sweeter than can - dy   by 
the pound.


Now I'm ducking in the alley of common sense.
Hiding from the claws of my old girl friend.
She's screaming murder beating my door down.
While I'm right behind it I'm eating candy by the pound.
I'm right behind it eating I'm candy by the pound.
