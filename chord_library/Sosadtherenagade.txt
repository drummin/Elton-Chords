So Sad The Renagade
(B-Side "All That I'm Allowed")

Intro:  E  G  D  A  E  G  D  A

E       C#m            D        A
You say I can't understand

       E      C#m                D      A 
The highway's hold on a troubled man

G        Bm                    C       D 
You want me but you don't know how

    G        Bm               F          C
To quit the chase and settle down

E         C#m            D    A
I don't know but I can tell

      E        C#m           D     A
You fill that saddle pretty well

      G       Bm                C     D
But God knows I need something too

G            Bm                   F     C   
I've hung in all these years for you

Chorus:

 C add B   A                F#m7     
So go   ahead and chase the wind

        E                      D      
And if someday you fold your wings

            G               Bm
I'll be the nest you never made

   F7add C#         E  
If not, so sad the renegade

    A                F#m7
So sad that you lost me

     E                   D
When all you ever had to be

             G                 Bm
Was balanced in the games you play

      F7add C#         E    A   
You'll lose so sad the renegade



You always had a cowboy heart
A wild horse running through the dark
A need to touch the jagged edge
To rock your heels upon the ledge

Everyone who's close to you
Reads your book and sees the clues
Tries to set you straight on me
The love you lose won't set you free

Chorus:

      D
It's only love that keeps me here

    C#m
Something in you I hold so dear

F7
I'm not out to change your ways

G
All I want is the chance to say

Chorus:

     A                  F#m7
Go ahead and chase the wind

       E                      D 
And if someday you fold your wings

            G               Bm
I'll be the nest you never made

   F7add C#        E    A    F  C  G
If not, so sad the renegade

A  F  C  G  D
