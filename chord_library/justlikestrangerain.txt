I looked up from my glass   -   into the sky.
Bb             Bbsus  Bb   Eb/Bb   Bb
There's no one in my comic book to hide.
     F                              Eb         Bb
The calendar swung on the wall held by a rusty nail.
Eb            Bb               F                          Eb/F | Bb/F  F |
Down came the strange rain and washed my thoughts away.



CHORUS:
Bb                  Bbsus   Bb         Eb                      Ebsus   Eb
So stop in the sky and tell me why you're changing your colours before my eyes.
F
Yellow, blue, green and grey - settled on the window pane.
Bb                  Bbsus   Bb         Eb                      Ebsus   Eb
So stop in the sky and tell me why you're changing your colours before my eyes.
F
Yellow, blue, green and grey - settled on the window pane.
Gb                    Db                 Ab
It made the rain that came seem strange  -  just like strange rain.
Gb                    C                  Ab
It made the rain that came seem strange  -  just like strange rain.

Instr: |  F  Eb/F  |  Bb/F  F  |  F  Eb/F  |  Bb/F  F  |



Bb            Bbsus    Bb       Eb/Bb         Bb    Eb/Bb
Still I sit before the fire and watched as it fell.
Bb              Bbsus  Bb     Eb/Bb     Bb
Come in colours from above in-to my citadel.
   F                                 Eb               Bb
My eyes are all embroidered with the rainbow you have made.
    Eb               Bb               F                       Eb/F | Bb/F  F |
And now it seems as though it's just, just like strange rain.
