Bb
Walk a mile in my tennis shoes.  Tina Turner gave me the highway blues.
       Eb7                               Bb
But I,      I don't love nobody but you, honey.
    Bb
I'm true rat for the things I done.  Second cousin to a son of a gun.
          Eb7                                       Bb
I'm gonna  -  wipe out your mama if she puts me on, honey.



CHORUS:
       /Ab    G7
`Cause I'm a  -  midnight creeper.  Ain't gonna lose no sleep over you.
               C7                    C7sus  C7
When there's a nightmare, I'm there    -    tempting you to blow a fuse.
             Bb7                       Eb7                    Bb7
Well there's no more sleeping when I'm midnight creeping over you.
          G7                   C7      F7                         {Replay Intro}
Watch out honey.     Watch out honey.     Watch the things you do.



Bb
Long haired ladies well they look so fine -
Bb
locked in my cellar full of cheap red wine.
     Eb7                                         Bb
But, I don't think those ladies they really mind honey.
  Bb
I still don't know why you hate me so.  Little bit of fun never stopped no show.
        Eb7                                 Bb
Well I,    I just want to loosen up my soul honey.


{Repeat Chorus}
