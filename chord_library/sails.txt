Em7                      A7
I viewed in my presence,    my hand on my forehead.
Em7                      Bm                 Am7
And sighting the liners  -  of mad merchant seamen.
Em7                      D                   Am7  {Melody: E-E-D-D-B-B-A-A}
In search of the living  -  or the spices of China.



Em7                 A7
Lucy walked gently  -  between the damp barrels.
Em7                   Bm                       Am7
And shut out my eyes  -  with the width of her fingers.
Em7                           D                 Am7  {Melody: E-E-D-D-B-B-A-A}
Said she'd guessed the number - of bales in the back room.



E7                                A/C#          Em7/B   Cmaj7
While the seagulls were screaming  -   Lucy was eat  -  ing.
E7                            A/C#                       Em7/B  Cmaj7
Then we hauled up our colours  -  the way the mother had told    us.
      Am             Bm          Em  {Melody: E  D-E  Bb-A-G  D-E  }
And together we just watched the sails.



Em7                A7                     Em7
Lucy, I said, in a passage of cotton kegs  -  "Can we hold hands?
Bm                 Am7
I'm sure that it's warmer."
Em7                                   D        Am7 {Melody: E  D-E  Bb-A-G  D-E}
     Then the gulls ate the crumbs of - Lucy's sandwich.
E7                                A/C#          Em7/B   Cmaj7
While the seagulls were screaming  -   Lucy was eat  -  ing.
E7                            A/C#                       Em7/B  Cmaj7
Then we hauled up our colours  -  the way the mother had told    us.
      Am             Bm          Em7
And together we just watched the sails.
