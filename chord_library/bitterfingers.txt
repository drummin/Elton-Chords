Bitter Fingers
by: Elton John

A			E	 F#m		F#m/G#    A - D/B
I'm going on the circuit, I'm doing all the clubs
Bm    E/C	   D		E		   Dsus/G		D/F#
And I really need a song boys to stir those workers up
A					   E		F#m	F#m/G#   A - D/B
And get their wives to sing it with me just like in the pubs
E/A       Bm       Bb/D	     D		E	 D/E
When I worked the good old pubs in Stepney

A			E	 F#m		F#m/G#    A - D/B
Oh could you knock a line or two together for a friend
Bm    E/C	   D		E		   Dsus/G		D/F#
Sentimental tear inducing with a happy end
A					   E		F#m	F#m/G#   A - D/B
And we need a tune to open our season at Southend
E/A       Bm       Bb/D	     D		E	 D/E
Can you help us

F					   C/G
It's hard to write a song with bitter fingers
G				     C/G 	
So much to prove, so few to tell you why
F								C/G
Those old die-hards in Denmark Street start laughing
G							
At the keyboard player's hollow haunted eyes

It seems to me a change is really needed
I'm sick of tra-la-las and la-de-das
No more long days hacking hunks of garbage
Bitter fingers never swung on swinging stars, swinging stars

I like the warm blue flame, the hazy heat it brings
It loosens up the muscles and forces you to sing
You know it's just another hit and run from the tin pan alley twins

And there's a chance that one day you might write a standard lads
So churn them out quick and fast and we'll still pat your backs
`Cause we need what we can get to launch another dozen acts
Are you working
