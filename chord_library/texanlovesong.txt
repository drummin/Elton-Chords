  Eb           Eb7               Db
I heard from a friend you'd been messing around -
Ab                                Eb       Eb7
with a cute little thing I'd been dating uptown.
                            Db
Well I don't know if I like that idea much.
Ab                                   Eb           Eb7
Well you'd better stay clear I might start acting rough.
    Db               Ab
You out of town guys sure think you're real keen.
      Bb7                      Eb
Think all of us boys here are  -  homespun and green.
           Db              Ab/C  Eb/Bb  Ab
But that's wrong my friend  so    get      this through your head:
                                 Ebm/Gb         Eb7 - Ab
We're tough and we're Texan with necks good and red.


CHORUS:
Ab      Eb/Bb    Fm                   Eb                      Db
     So it's     Ki yi yippie yi yi.  You long hairs are sure gonna die.
Fm           Bb7                     Eb7    Eb
Our American home was clean till you came.
Ebsus - Db           Eb                      Ab   Db - Ab
 And    kids still respected the president's name.
    /G  Fm                            Eb                 Db
And the eagle still flew in the sky.  Hearts filled with national pride.
Fm             Bb7            /D         Eb
Then you came along with your drug-crazy songs.
    Db           Eb        Ab
God-damit you're all gonna die.


Instr: Ab ///   // /Bb /C   Db / Ab/C /   Bbm ///   Ab / Db7 /   Ab ///


Eb           Eb7           Db
How dare you sit there and drink all our beer.
Ab                              Eb            Eb7
Oh it's made for us workers who sweat, spit & swear.
                               Db
The minds of our daughters are poisoned by you -
Ab                                       Eb       Eb7
with your communistic politics and them  -  negro blues.
         Db                 Ab
Well I'm gonna quit talking and take action now.
    Bb7                      Eb
Run all of you fairies clean out of this town.
        Db                      Ab/C  Eb/Bb  Ab
Oh I'm  -  dog tired of watching       you   mess up our lives.
                        Ebm/Gb    Eb7 - Ab
Spending the summertime naturally high.
