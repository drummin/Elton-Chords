Intro: D  Em  D/F#  G  A7



Bm         Em7           A            D
How have I come to this?   How did I slip and fall?
Gmaj7/B                 A                       | D          *   *  G/D | D   A7/C# |
How did I throw half a lifetime away without any thought at all?
Bm             Em7                 A                 D
This should've been my time.  It's over, it never began.
Gmaj7/B                   A                       | D          * * G/D | D   A7/C# |
Facing a world, for once not on my side - I simply turned and ran.



| C/E    D7/F#        | G      | A7/G                      F#m
I try to blame it on   fortune.  Some kind of twist in the stars.
Bm                           Em7           A7                      D
But I know the truth and it haunts me.  I learned it a little too late.
C/E        D7/F#         G        A7/G                    | F#sus * F# * | Bm
I know the truth and it mocks me.   I know the truth and it shocks         me.
           Em           A     G/D  D   Em   D/F#   G   A7
     Itís flown just a little too far.



Bm           Em7           A            D
People have faith in me.      I think I once did too.
Gmaj7/B                  A                            | D        * * G/D | D  A7/C# |
I promise whoever has a hold on our lives I'll see the bad times thru.
Bm                    Em7            A                 D
This   shouldíve been my time.  It's over, it never began.
