    D		   C\D           C\D C\Db
The weather man he looks confused

C		         G		    D
Shakes his fist at the sky like you used to do

    D				   C\D
But you don't remember things like that do you

    C		      G			D
The balance was uneven but I'm breaking through


C    G		D
Slow rivers run cold

C        G	     F	     G
Shallow waters never sank so low

Bb		 	      C     G
I thought I'd drown and you'd never know

	 D		    C      G    D
You're a slow river and you run so cold


    D			C\D         C\D C\Db
The winter here don't believe in God

    C				   G		  D
The bitter wind just bites through me like a wild dog

        D				     C\D
I still see your eyes tonight like headlights through the fog

    C			    G			D
But one foot in your door oh that's all I ever got

(CHORUS)

G\B		   C
Chances are you'll reappear

D		 Em
Swim my way in a flood of tears

F		      G
No place to hide your conscience so

	 C		      D
You're a sinking ship with no place to go

(CHORUS)
