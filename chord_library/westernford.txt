Western Ford Gateway
Elton John/Bernie Taupin
Album: Empty Sky

intro:
F  C/G  E7/G#  Am  F  C/G  E7/G#  Am  F  C/G  G7 


C                 G/B            Am   Am/G
It's hard to feel what's in your head
          F
Where the gas lamps grow
           C
And the garbage blows
Dm               E7
Around the paper stands
      Am 
And a baby cried
      Am/G
And I saw a light
          F
And I wondered where
       D
And I wondered why
             F
There'd be a loss of life
     C/G    G7
Down here tonight

C               F
Down on Western Ford Gateway
Dm             G6        G7
That's a place where the dead say
C                F
That a man lives no more
         C/G  E7/G#    Am
That his fair share of days
F       C       E7/G#    A
Down on Western Ford Gateway (repeat)


repeat intro here


It flowed upon the cobbled floor
For the bottle's dead
And they're drunk again
By the tavern door

outro is same as intro
