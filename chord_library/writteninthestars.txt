C	     F3   F          C          E7\G#  E7\B
I am here to tell you we can never meet again

Am  	       C\G	   F               G7   Gdim
Simple really, isn't it, a word or two and then

  C		  F3  F            C		 E7\G#  E7\B
A lifetime of not knowing where or how or why or when

    Am             C\G 		  F                  C\E
You think of me or speak of me or wonder what befell

    Dm			           G7          Gdim
The someone you once loved so long ago so well


C	     F3   F	       C		E7\G#  E7\B
Never wonder what I'll feel as living shuffles by

Am		  C\G        F          G7    Gdim
You don't have to ask me and I need not reply

C            F3 F	     C		  E7\G#  E7\B 
Every moment of my life from now until I die

Am		C\G		 F       	   C\E 
I will think or dream of you and fail to understand

      Dm			     G7          Gdim
How a perfect love can be confounded out of hand


      C 		   G\B
Is it written in the stars

       Am		     C\G
Are we paying for some crime

	Am7\F   		Dm\E
Is that all that we are good for

       Dm		     G
Just a stretch of mortal time


	C		 G\B
Is this God's experiment

   Am			C\G
In which we have no say

   Am7\F		     Dm\E
In which we're given paradise

    Dm   G         C  F3 F  C  F3 F
But only for a day


C	       F3 F              C                E7\G# E7\B
Nothing can be altered, there is nothing to decide

Am	      C\G                 F	           G7 Gdim
No escape, no change of heart, no anyplace to hide

C		 F3 F           C	     E7\G# E7\B
You are all I'll ever want, but this I am denied

Am		C\G		  F			   C\E
Sometimes in my darkest thoughts, I wish I'd never learned

	Dm			       G7	     Gdim
What it is to be in love and have that love returned
