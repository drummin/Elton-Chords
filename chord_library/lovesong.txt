Writer:  Lesley Duncan


Gm7
The words I have to say 

C7
May well be simple but they're true,

Gm7
Until you give your love,

C7
There's nothing more that we can do.


Gm7         C7
Love is the opening door

Gm7          C7 C6   C7   C6
Love is what we came here for

Gm7          C7 C6 C7  C6
No one could offer you more

Gm7                C7
Do you know what I mean?

Gm7                   C7
Have your eyes really seen?


Gm7
You say it's very hard

C7
To leave behind the life we knew,

Gm7
But there's no other way 

C7
And now it's really up to you


Gm7         C7
Love is the key we must turn.

Gm7          C7    C6 C7   C6
Truth us the flame we must burn.

Gm7         C7 C6     C7 C6
Freedom the lesson we must learn.

Gm7              C7
Do you know what I mean?

Gm7                   C7
Have your eyes really seen?
