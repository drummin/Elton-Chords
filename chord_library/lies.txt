Gm                 /D    Gm / Gm7 /  Eb                 Bb
Some lie about who they love.        Some lie about the truth.
F                 /F#  Gm / Gm7 /   Eb                   D7   /  D7sus   D7
Some lie to save their lives.       Some lie about their youth.
Gm                 /D  Gm / Gm7 /  Eb              Bb
Some lie about age and beauty   -  the conquest of sex.
F              /F#  Gm      /   Gm7 /   Eb               D7     /   D7sus  D7
Most lie about the night before.      A woman lies for a party dress.
Eb                     Bb        Eb                     Bb
I've lied for a stolen moment.   I've lied for one more clue.
Ab                   Gm               Eb            D7     D7sus  D7
I've lied about most everything but I never lied to you.    And   we...


CHORUS:
       Bb                   F
And we lie, lie, lie - on a streetcar named desire.
   /F#  Gm        Eb                           F
Oh, we  lie, lie, lie - for that sweet bird of youth.
           Cm                   D7sus   D7
I could be great like Tennessee Williams -
           G7/B      Cm             Eb     D7sus  D7  Gm
if I could only hear something that sounds like   the truth.


Gm                   /D  Gm / Gm7 /  Eb                   Bb
Some lie in the face of death.       Some lie about their fame.
F                 /F#  Gm / Gm7 /   Eb                   D7   /   D7sus   D7
Some kneel and lie to  God.         Some lie about their name.
Gm                 /D    Gm / Gm7 /  Eb                 Bb
Some lie in words and speeches with every living breath.
F                  /F#   Gm  /  Gm7 /     Eb                     D7 / D7sus D7
The young lie with their guitars.     The old lie for a little respect.
Eb                    Bb             Eb                 Bb
I've lied to lie with danger.   I've lied for a drug or two.
Ab                   Gm                 Eb            D7     D7sus  D7
I've lied about most everything - but I never lied to you.    And   we...


{Repeat Chorus & Instrumental verse}


Eb                     Bb        Eb                     Bb
I've lied for a stolen moment.   I've lied for one more clue
Ab                   Gm                 Eb            D7     D7sus  D7
I've lied about most everything - but I never lied to you.    And   we...
