Gm7 Gm7 Gm6+ Gm6+ Gm6 Gm6 Gm (Gm Cm7 Cm7 Cm7 Gm Adim Adim D7 D7)*

Gm				  F
What have I got to do to make you love me

F				  Bb    Adim Cdim
What have I got to do to make you care

Gm			    Cm
What do I do when lightning strikes me

F				   Bb    Adim Cdim
And I wake to find that you're not there


Gm			 F
What do I do to make you want me

F			    Bb    Adim Cdim
What have I got to do to be heard

Gm			    Cm
What do I say when it's all over

    F				  Bb   F\A  
And sorry seems to be the hardest word


Eb	 D
It's sad, so sad

Gm              Cm
It's a sad, sad situation

Eb 		 D 		     Gm  Adim D7
And it's getting more and more absurd

Eb	  D
It's sad, so sad

Gm
Why can't we talk it over

Eb                Eb Bb\D
Oh it seems to me

     Cm		    D		   Gm
That sorry seems to be the hardest word

*  The chord progression at the beginning and end of the song (Gm Cm7 Cm7 Cm7 Gm Adim Adim D7 D7)
should be played with the chords in the left hand, quarter notes, and these single notes in the right:

Bb A G D Eb    B C D  Eb D C Eb   G Gb G A G Gb (D7 D7 [CHORDS HERE])
Gm       Cm7 Cm7   Cm7   Gm  Adim Adim     D7    D7 D7

Ad lib in the right hand, if possible.  These notes are a scaled-down version, as heard on the recording.
Listen to live versions to get some other ideas.
