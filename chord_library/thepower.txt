Intro:  Bb                            Ab             Eb  {twice}
        Ooh, ooh.     Ohh-ooh-ooh.    Ooh-ooh,  ooh.


        Bb          Eb/Bb     Bb                           Eb       Bb   Eb/F
I have sold myself through & through. I have walked in the darkness too.
Bb            Eb/Bb  Bb
Felt a red sun, the living proof,
           Gb           Ab     Bb    Eb/Bb-Bb
washed my hands in the honest truth.


Eb/F        Bb                 Eb/Bb       Bb
  I   have carried this weight time after time.
                        Eb/Bb       Bb
I have battled the dumb  and   the blind.
           Eb              Ab/Eb   Eb
I've seen dignity fail and colours run.
      Bb                   Eb/Bb      Bb
Seen justice denied by the voice of a gun.



CHORUS:      Cm(add F)/Bb - Bb             Bb/D
And we walk,                        yes we walk -
        Eb            Eb7        Bb
And we walk with the power every day.
       F                      Bb     Cm(add F)/Bb - Bb    Cm(add F)/Bb - Bb
Never letting the light slip away.
         Bb            Bb/D             Eb                 Bb
Reaching out, reaching in  -  touching truth and touching skin.
      F                       Bb      Cm(add F)/Bb - Bb (twice)
Never letting the light slip away.
        Eb           Gb    Ab    Bb
And we walk with the power every day


If my faith is a fire then burn baby burn.  
We've held fire long enough to learn.
Heat beneath hope is a healing light - kept alive by the flames of night.
Walk tall in the power - day after day.
And never, never, never lose sight of the way.
See the dawn come and the dusk hang.
See the power rise from an open hand.
