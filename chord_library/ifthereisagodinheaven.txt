Intro:  C  Bm    C - Bm - A   {play twice}

A         A/E   A        D/A        A
Torn from their families mothers go hungry-
     C#m           F#m            Bm7         E7-D/E  E7
     to feed their children - but children go hungry.
        A    A/E   A               D/A                  A
There's so many   big men, they're out making millions.
     C#m       F#m       Bm7            E7-D/E  E7    C   Bm
When poverty's profits - just blame the chil - dren.



CHORUS:      F#m                     A7
If there's a God in heaven what's he waiting for?
      Bm             F#m               D           E7
If He can't hear the children then he must see the war.
        F#m                 A7
But it seems to me that he leads his lambs -
          C          Bm               C  Bm     A      {replay intro}
   to the slaughter house and not the promised land.


A     A/E  A          D/A        A
Dying for causes they don't understand.
           C#m          F#m           Bm7          E7-D/E   E7
We've been taking their futures right out of their hands.
A         A/E  A          D/A           A
They need the handouts to hold back the tears.
        C#m     F#m        Bm7         E7-D/E   E7
There's so many crying but so few that hear.



{Repeat Chorus}


             F#m            A7                 F#m           E7
If there's a God in heaven  -  well, what's he waiting for?

E7  Bm     D/E  F#m            A7  C   Bm            C   Bm   A
If there's  a   God in heaven     -        what's he waiting for?
