Circle of Life
Words and Music by: Elton John and Tim Rice

intro: Bb - Bb/G - Cm - F

Bb                             Cm/Bb
From the day we arrive on the planet
F                           Bb
And blinking, step into the sun
Gm                                 Cm
There's more to be seen than can ever be seen
        Ab                  F
More to do than can ever be done

Bb                 Cm/Bb
Some say eat or be eaten
F                      Bb
Some say live and let live
Gm                          Cm
But all are agreed as they join the stampede
            Ab                       F
You should never take more than you give

                 Bb    Eb/Bb - Bb
In the circle of life
                  Bb/Cm    
It's the wheel of fortune
                  Eb
It's the leap of faith
                 F/Eb
It's the band of hope
                   Bb/D  G
Till we find our place 
                  Cm   F#
On the path unwinding
        Bb    F               Eb  (F#)  Bb
In the circle, the circle of life

Bb                     Cm/Bb
Some of us fall by the wayside
F                        Bb
And some of soar to the stars
Gm                               Cm
And some of us sail through our troubles
     Ab                         F
And some have to live with the scars

Bb                              Cm/Bb
There's far too much to take in here
F                              Bb
More to find than can ever be found
Gm                                    Cm
But the sun rolling high through the sapphire sky
Ab                                    F
Keeps great and small on the endless round
