         Bb7   Eb7       Bb7              Bb7        Eb7            Bb7
Have you ever lived in a cage?  Where you live to be whipped and be tamed.
                                  Ab     Gb   Db     Eb      Bb7
For I've never loved in a cage or talked to a friend or just waved.
     Gb                   F7                     Bb7
Ah - roo - hoo.       A - roo - hoo.       Ahh - ahh.



       Bb7             Eb7        Bb7
Well I walk while they talk about virtue.
     Bb7          Eb7         Bb7
Just raised on my back legs & snarled
            Bb7                                    Ab   Gb    Db    Eb    Bb7
Watched you kiss your old daddy with passion - and tell dirty jokes as he died.
     Gb                   F7                     Bb7
Ah - roo - hoo.       A - roo - hoo.       Ahh - ahh.



        Bb7           Eb7    Bb7
But I'm damned when I really care there.
        Bb7          Eb7          Bb7
For the cellar's the room in your lives.
          Bb7                                Ab        Gb    Db      Eb   Bb7
Where you lace yourself with bad whiskey and close the cage doors on your life.
     Gb                   F7                     Bb7
Ah - roo - hoo.       A - roo - hoo.       Ahh - ahh.

       Bb7            Eb7          Bb7
Well I pray while you bathe in bad water.
     Bb7           Eb7        Bb7
Sing songs that I learnt as a boy.
     Bb7                                   Ab   Gb      Db    Eb   Bb7
Then break all the bones in my body on the bars you can never de - stroy.
     Gb                   F7                     Bb7
Ah - roo - hoo.       A - roo - hoo.       Ahh - ahh.
