Looking Up

Intro: A  -  G – D - A
A    
Figuring out where I went wrong
F#m            Em                D           
The script not followed then was awfully long 
A        Bm7       A/C#    F#m
Too much pluck, too little of
D                    A
The acting right not acting up
A
I’ve worn the world upon my back
      F#m             Em        D               
Would someone else but me, pick up the slack? 
A       Bm7  A/C#    F#m
Just because I could say
D                          A
It's my life, do things my way

D
Now I'm looking up more than I look down
A                                     D     A
The view's a whole lot better second time around
D
Too much of me was hidden in the shadows
  Bm7           A/C#    D                
I looked up and felt my feet lift off the ground

A  -  G – D - A



Color a lot with a broader stroke
The laughter comes as easy as the jokes
Nowadays, I'm thinking 'bout
Time is wasted looking back

D
Now I'm looking up more than I look down
A                                     D     A
The view's a whole lot better second time around
D
Too much of me was hidden in the shadows
  Bm7           A/C#    D                
I looked up and felt my feet lift off the ground

G				  D
You drop a bucket in a well
    A				   E
It's dark and deep down there
Em			 D/F#
Crank the handle, bring it up
G			    E     D/E        E
The water, crystal clear
