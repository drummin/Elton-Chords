Music By: Elton John
Words By: Taupin
Album: Rock of the Westies 1975


G/B                      C       Bm/D
Like a corn in a field I cut you down
C/E                        F9
I threw the last punch too hard
      G/B                  G        E9
After years of going steady, well I thought that it was time
   Am7                               D11
To throw in my hand for a new set of cards
G/B	                     Cmaj7      Bm/D
And I can't take you dancing out on the weekend
  C/E                                   F9
I figured we'd painted too much of this town
      G/B                    G            E9
And I tried not to look as I walked to my wagon
      Am7             D11       Cm     Em7
And I knew then I had lost what should have been found
  Am7             D11       D7               G
I knew then I had lost what should have been found


Fm7               Bb                   Eb     C7
And I feel like a bullet in the gun of Robert Ford
    Db                Eb
I'm low as a paid assassin is
             Ab        Cm    Fm
You know I'm cold as a hired sword
Ab                                  Eb7sus
I'm so ashamed can't we patch it up
Ab       Db                        Fm
You know I can't think straight no more
Bb7                                         Eb11                Db  Ab
You make me feel like a bullet honey in the gun of Robert Ford

(repeat verse chords)

Like a child when his toy's been stepped on
That's how it all seemed to me
I burst the bubble that both of us lived in
And I'm damned if I'll ever get rid of this guilt that I feel
And if looks could kill then I'd be a dead man
Your friends and mine don't call no more
Hell, I thought it was best but now I feel branded
Breaking up's sometimes like breaking the law
Breaking up's sometimes like breaking the law

to chorus
play verse chords again for instrumental break
play chorus again
