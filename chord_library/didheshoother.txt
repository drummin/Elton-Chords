	   Bb       
Sling your hook in with him baby

       Ab   
He's a real sharp-shooter now

	Eb
If he's out there hiding in the tall grass

		Eb\Bb Bb  Bb Eb\Bb Bb  Eb\Bb Bb Bb
Tell him I said he    was a  cow-  ard


	   Bb
This ain't any old western honey

	 Ab
It's the twentieth century now

          Eb
But if he thinks he's some kind of tough cowboy

		         Eb\Bb Bb Bb   Eb\Bb Bb  Eb\Bb Bb Bb
And he's hurt her then I want  to know how-  ow


       Eb\Bb Bb  Bb 	     Eb\Bb Bb  Bb
Did he shoot her    with his com-  promise

       Ab6   Ab Ab          Cm\G G G
Like a heart at-tack he can par- alyse

          Cm
Or did he hang her in a noose

F		 Eb\Bb Bb Bb  Eb\Bb Bb Bb
On the telephone li-   ine


       Eb\Bb Bb Bb       Eb\Bb Bb Bb
Did he shoot her  with a for-  ty five

       Ab6   Ab  Ab           Cm\G  G   G
Did he leave his mark right between her eyes

          Cm
Oh did he shoot that girl

F               Eb\Bb Bb  Bb  Eb\Bb Bb Bb
That used to be mi-   ine


             Bb
Tell him I'm ready any time he chooses

                    Ab
The pay-off for the things, for the things he's done

	 Eb
He ain't messing with no two-bit bandit

             Eb\Bb Bb  Bb     Eb\Bb Bb Bb
Armed with a cou-  ple of guns


	       Bb
If he wants to see it as a two reel movie

		   Ab
He's living in the head of someone else

	   Eb
But better take him down and dust him honey

                   Eb\Bb Bb  Bb Bb   Eb\Bb Bb Bb
I want to hear the truth for my-self

(CHORUS)

       Eb\Bb Bb  Bb  Eb\Bb Bb Bb
Did he shoot her

       Eb\Bb Bb
Did he shoot her
