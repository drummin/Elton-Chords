Intro
Cm - Ab ñ G/B - Cm (2x)

    Cm                                      Fm7 
The sun is up and the shades are all pulled down
         Bb            Bdim         Cm
I'm more paranoid with every little sound
         Cm                             Fm7 
Like the leaf blower blowing the leaves around
        G/B                Gaug           Cm
And a siren wailing on the other side of town

       Cm                                   Ab 
Oh the TVs on and the colors really hurt my head
            Bb               Bdim        Cm
If I could think straight I'd wish I was dead
    Cm                           Fm7 
Or curled up naked in my lover's bed
            G/B                Bdim                  Cm
Instead I'm hanging over Hell suspended by a single thread

[chorus:]
      Fm                               G/B    
And I don't recall who said it at this time
          Fm7             Bb                    Ab  Bb
That your enemies grow strong on what you leave behind
           Fm7                      Bb
I built it up and the wolf he came around
              Fm7                   Bb                     Bdim
He huffed and puffed, he huffed and puffed, he huffed and puffed, 
               Cm               Fm7  Bdim  Cm  
he huffed and puffed,  and the house fell down

(Repeat C-blues scale run)

         Cm                                 Fm7
With a rolled up note I'm hovering on that line
       Bb          G/B               Cm
Three days on a diet of cocaine and wine
        Cm                               Fm7
And a little weed just to level me sometime
           G                                                Cm
I put the clock in the drawer 'cause I've cancelled out the time

[repeat chorus]
  Cm
So don't knock on my door, don't try to call
I'm holed up in this room talking to the wall
When you're high as this you think you know it all
                                                    G
When you're this deep in there's no place else to fall

(Solo C blues riff ñ Starts out G-Eb-C-G-Eb, C-F-Eb F-Eb-C-F-Eb C-Eb-F-Gb-F-Eb-C, etc)

[repeat chorus]

      Fm7                             Bb
And still that saying gets inside my mind
          Fm7             Bb                    Ab  Bb
That your enemies grow strong on what you leave behind
           Fm7                      Bb
I built it up and the wolf he came around
              Fm7                   Bb                     Bdim
He huffed and puffed, he huffed and puffed, he huffed and puffed, 
               Cm               Fm7  Bdim  Cm  
he huffed and puffed,  and the house fell down

(Repeat C-blues scale run)
