Bad Side Of The Moon
Music by Elton John
Lyrics by Bernie Taupin
Released as UK B-Side in 1970 (Also available on the LIVE! album 11-17-70)

[Intro (where each || represents one measure of 4/4)]:
||: Eb		Db	 | Ab 		Eb :|| (repeat 4x)
    Ousemala    ousemala   ousemala  ________
Gb	Ab

   Eb			Ab
It seems as though I've lived my life
	Db		Bbm7
On the bad side of the moon
   Ab		       Gb
To stir your dregs in sickness still
   Db/F		    Eb	 Ab/Eb
Without the rustic spoon

Common people live with me
Where the light has never shone
And the hermits flock like hummingbirds
To speak in a foreign tongue

[Chorus] (1st time: repeat once):
||:Db		  Ab
I'm a light world away
	 Gb		    Ab
>From the people who make me stay
Eb	       Gb       Db     Eb :||		
Sitting on the bad side of the moon
[After repeat: continue...]
Gb	Ab					<<-- (3rd TIME ONLY - GO TO CODA)
[Play Intro 3x with 'ousemala']
Gb	Ab

There ain't no need for watchdogs here
To justify our ways
We live our life in manacles
The main cause of our stay

Exiled here from other worlds
My sentence comes too soon
Why should I be made to pay
On the bad side of the moon

[Chorus] (follow same instructions as above and go to coda when prompted)

[Coda]:
(Play Intro - Repate and Fade)
