F		  C
I was born in the north of England

      Dm 	      F\C Bb
I was raised in a working town

  F			     C
I broke all the rules when I went to school

	Bb		         G\B
But the teachers couldn't pin me down


C		   F
I tried to make my parents proud

     A			  Dm
By adapting to the social powers

F\C  F		            C
Oh   pigs will fly, and the earth will fry

	  Bb		      G\B
When they get me doing honest hours


Dm       F\C  Bb
Snookeroo,    Snookeroo

C	      F            C\E
Daddy's going on the booze

Dm	              G
Mother used to cut my hair

    C		   Dm   Eb  C7\E
And sister used to make the news


	  Dm	      F\C  Bb 
Oh it was two rooms up and two rooms down

	    G\B			      C
And we were sentenced by the wrecking crane

      F		  F\C    Bb    F\A
I was born on the eve of Halloween

    Dm	      F\C   Bb      C               F     Eb  Bb\D C 
And Snookeroo,    Snookeroo, Snookeroo's my name, Snooker-oo


F		  C
I need someone to cook for me

    Dm  	  F\C Bb
And turn me loose at  night

        F		     C
I could spend my life with a factory girl

 	   Bb		     G\B
'Cause the factory girl's my type


C		   F
I hear them gossip on the street

A		         Dm
Most of what they say is true

F\C  F			   C
Oh   don't you know that I hear them say

		Bb		     G\B
There goes that lazy, no-good Snookeroo
