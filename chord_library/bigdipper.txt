      G                
Now I saw you talking to a cute little slip of a sailor

       G
And it looked at first like the whole thing would end as a failure

         C                        G
He had a thing about a quarter to four

            Bm                      Em  D4
And he just couldn't handle any more

             G      		  D                    G    Am    G\B 
He's got his own big dipper so he won't be needing your big dipper

             C                     D                      G  D
He's got his own big dipper and he won't be needing yours


       G
So you filled him up with all kinds of stuff to relax him

        G
And you took him down to the fairground after some action

       C                            G
And by around about a quarter to six

            Bm        			    Em  D4
You found a different way to get your kicks

          G                         D 
Up on the real big dipper where you tried an few new tricks

    Am     G\B 
Big dipper

        C     			 D   		  G    D
Up on a great big dipper did you learn a few new licks

G

G

          C        	 	 G
He hadn't been too keen at the start

       Bm 			      Em  D4
Now he seems to have a change of heart

             G
He's got his own big dipper

     D                  G      Am    G\B
Only now he's not so sure, big dipper

             C
He's got his own big dipper

            D                   G
But there's always room for more


                  G
Everybody's got a song to sing

G                                      C           G
Everybody's got to do their thing, big dipper, big dipper

G                                      C           G
Everybody's got to do their thing, big dipper, big dipper


 	C			    G
And at around about a quarter to ten

        Bm                     Em  D4
You got up and did it all again

             G 			  	 D                   G 
He's got his own big dipper and now he knows just what it's for

     Am    G\B  
Big dipper

	     C 			     D                   
He's got his own big dipper but he's got his eye on yours


G                                      C           G
Everybody's got to do their thing, big dipper, big dipper

G                                      C           G
Everybody's got to do their thing, big dipper, big dipper

G                                      C           G
Everybody's got to do their thing, big dipper, big dipper

G                                      C           G
Everybody's got to do their thing, big dipper, big dipper

         G             D
Another ride, another tune

        G\B          F9
Another crazy afternoon

         G            D               G
Another reason for squeezing your big dipper
