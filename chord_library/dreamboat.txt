D			 G
Steamboat waiting by the waterside

D			G
Sunlight shining on the morning tide

F      C\G	    D
Got my ticket in my hand

F	 D\E	     D
Got some celebrating planned


D		      G
Can't remember when I felt so fine

D			 G
I've been waiting such a long long time

F	C\G		   D
Just to hear those engines hum

F	 C\E		  D
Look out dreamboat here I come


	  Dmaj7    D		     G
And I say dream on dreamboat, let my love light ride

Dmaj7	 D		  G
Steam on steamboat to the other side

E	    G7
All aboard, make it fast

E			   A	   G
Thank the lord, I'm coming home at last


D			G
If you love me like you did before

D			G
Be there waiting on the distant shore

F	C\G		  D
When my steamboat comes inside

F      C\E	       D
Then I know we'll be alright


	  Dmaj7    D		     G
And I say dream on dreamboat, let my love light ride

Dmaj7	 D		  G
Steam on steamboat to the other side

E		G7
Turn the crank, change the gear

E			     A      G
Raise the flag and let's get out of here

(INTRO)

D			   G
Feels so good to know that soon I'll see

D			    G
You've been saving all your love for me

F	  C\G		 D
For honey if there's any doubt

F	C\E		  D
Just be sure I don't find out


	  Dmaj7    D		     G
And I say dream on dreamboat, let my love light ride

Dmaj7	 D		  G
Steam on steamboat to the other side

E	       G7
Cast the line, check the fuse

E			      A	       G
save some time, this ain't no pleasure cruise


D			G
Tell the captain not to take too long

D			    G
Keep that big wheel turning fast and strong

F	  C\G		 D
Fires are burning down below

F	C\E		   D
Come on steamboat don't be slow


	  Dmaj7    D		     G
And I say dream on dreamboat, let my love light ride

Dmaj7	 D		  G
Steam on steamboat to the other side

E		  G7
Wind the springs, set the course

E			   A       G
Pull some strings before I turn to force

(INSTRUMENTAL VERSE)

And I say dream on dreamboat, let my love light ride

Dmaj7	 D		  G
Steam on steamboat to the other side

Ring the bell, sound the horn

Move like hell, I'm heading back where I was born
