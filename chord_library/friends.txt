Friends
{Words and Music by Elton John & Bernie Taupin}



  Gm7               /C            F        Fsus4-F
I hope the day will be a lighter highway.
         Cm7/Eb      Bb/D            F     Fsus4-F
     For friends are found on every road.
        Gm7           /C          F  Fsus4-F        Cm7/Eb          Bb/D         C7
Can you ever think of any better way    ñ    for the lost and weary traveller to go?



        /D      Eb     Bb/F    Eb/F     Bb
Chorus: Making friends for the world to see.
         F                  Eb       Ab       Bb
        Let the people know you got what you need.
         F                     /A   Bb
        With a friend at hand   -   you will see the light.
                 Gm7                   Ab    Eb          Bb
        If your friends are there then everything's all right.



    Gm7           /C                   F        Fsus4-F
It seems to me a crime that we should age.
      Cm7/Eb               Bb/D          F     Fsus4-F
These fragile times should never slip us by.
  Gm7            /C             F     Fsus4-F
A time you never can or shall erase -
        Cm7/Eb           Bb/D                  C7     /D
     as friends together watch their childhood fly.
