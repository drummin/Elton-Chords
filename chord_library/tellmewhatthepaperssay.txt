I spy headlines.   Newsprint tells lies.    Tell me what the papers 
say.
                                                       F
Save lives - don't drive.   Everybody's got to die someday.
                                C7
At least that's what the papers say.


      C            G      F                  C/E    F       G
Coal mines closed down.   Nobody's working under - ground today.
      C                G    F          C/E  F             G
More jails, peace for sale.   Japanese     still killing whales.
      C                         C7                              F7
Teen dreams on two inch screens.   Lipstick boys all look like queens.
                              C  {replay intro}
Least that's what the papers say.

Dope and pills, guns kill.   Death just buys cheap thrills.

Coal mines, closed down.   Nobody's working under - ground today.
