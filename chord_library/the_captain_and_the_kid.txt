----------------------------------------------1.verse

F                     Bb/F F
I've been out on this road some
                             C/E                Dm
Can't help feeling I've been showing my friends around
             Bb                   Bb/A
I've seen it growing from next to nothing
       Gm    Gm/F           C/E
Into a giant eating up your town

F                               Bb/F   F
Called up the tealeaves and the ta-----rots
                         C/E                     Dm                          
Asked the gypsy what she sees in the palm of our hands
          Bb           Bb/A    
She saw a mountain and wild deer running
  Gm          Gm/F            C/E
A crazy kid becoming a better man

       Gm                   
But we stuck around for the fireworks
        Gm/F    C/E
Waiting to   ex-plode
           A              Dm
Shaped our futures, you a tumbleweed
    Bb                   C
And me on a yellow brick road
             Gm                
Pleasing the people some of the time
           Gm/F   C/E
For better or for worse
         A                   Dm
An urban soul in a fine silk Suit
                Bb        G/B      C
And a heart out west in a Wrangler shirt

----------------------------------------------chorus
                 F                      Dm
And you can't go back and if you try it fails
           Bb                  F
Looking up ahead I see a rusty nail
               F                          Dm
A sign hanging from it saying "Truth for sale"
                   Bb
And that's what we did
   G/B              F/C
No lies at all just one more tale
          A/C             Dm
About the Captain and the Kid

----------------------------------------------1.verse

F                     Bb/F     F
We've been missing at times in action
                      C/E                 Dm
Can't imagine what he said he might do for you
          Bb                 Bb/A
The devil got to come to the party sometimes
Gm          Gm/F            C/E
But he never got to wear our shoes

F                         Bb/F     F
Oh we've conjured up what we   cre-ated
                         C/E                     Dm
Way back then when I was standing up in six-inch heels
            Bb                 Bb/A
Now you're riding off into the sunset
Gm                     Gm/F             C/E
And I'm still spinning like a Catherine wheel

       Gm
But we stuck around for the battle
        Gm/F  C/E
Waiting for a plan
            A                   Dm
To turn you into the Brown Dirt Cowboy
    Bb               C
And me into a rocket man
               Gm          
It pleases the people some of the time
           Gm/F   C/E
Digging in-to our roots
            A                 Dm
But I got a brand new pair of shoes
                Bb       G/B        C
And you're on a horse in old cowboy boots
