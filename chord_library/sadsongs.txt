SAD SONGS (SAY SO MUCH)

Year:  1984
Album:  BREAKING HEARTS
Writers:  Elton John\ Bernie Taupin

C  F  G  C  C  F  G  C  

       		 C				   F
Guess there are times when we all need to share a little pain

		     G
And ironing out the rough spots

     			 C
Is the hardest part when memories remain

	  C						F
And it's times like these when we all need to hear the radio

 		 G
`Cause from the lips of some old singer

			  C
We can share the troubles we already know


C
Turn them on, turn them on

	      F
Turn on those sad songs

		  G
When all hope is gone

				    C
Why don't you tune in and turn them on


		     C
They reach into your room

		 F
Just feel their gentle touch

		  G
When all hope is gone

		  C
Sad songs say so much


		    C			 F
If someone else is suffering enough to write it down

		  G
When every single word makes sense

		    C
Then it's easier to have those songs around

	    C				     F
The kick inside is in the line that finally gets to you

			G
and it feels so good to hurt so bad

			  C
And suffer just enough to sing the blues

(CHORUS)

		F
Sad songs, they say

		G
Sad songs, they say

		F
Sad songs, they say

		G   F\C G
Sad songs, they say so  much

(CHORUS)

 		  G			 C
When all hope is gone, sad songs say so much.

After you've learned this song's basic chord formation, I'd suggest embellishing it with some
fancier chord progressions, in very much the style of a Western saloon.

Let's face it, Elton wrote the music in 3 minutes, and it is not a very exciting piece.  I definitely
would try to take it to another place musically.
