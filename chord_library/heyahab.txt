Hey Ahab

Cm (little intro riff being  RH twiddly bit - G Eb D C C Bb C C - X 3  BASS descending each time starting with C, then Bb, Ab into F7 (RH octives down - Bb A G Eb D C Bb)   -  Something like that as many times as you feel like repeating.

      
        Cm                                                               
It's a constant struggle getting up that hill
              F7
There's a change of guard every day
                   Cm
When you're clinging onto a driftwood boat
                 F7
You pray a great white whale might come your way
     Ab7
No freeway traffic in the frozen North
          F7
Just a chain link fence full of birds
                     Ab7
And when the harpoon's loaded in the cannon bay
             G7
You'll be rolling through the pages lost for words

chorus

Hey hey
Cm                       Eb
Hey Ahab can you tell me where
         F7              Ab
I can catch a ride out of here  - hey hey
Cm          Eb
Hey Ahab hoist that sail
           F7
You've gotta stand up straight
                G7                         (BACK TO TWIDDLY INTRO)
When you ride that whale



In a crumbling city we were trapped for days
With a broken sun above the clouds
Caught like Jonah forty fathoms down
And a sign on the wall says, "Hope Allowed"
All the cryptic symbols carved on bone
A far cry from a tattooed rose
And when the boys in the rigging catch the wind 
We'll all weigh anchor and it's westward ho
