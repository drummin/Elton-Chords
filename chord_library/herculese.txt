Ooh I got a busted wing and a hornet sting

Like an out of tune guitar

And Diana in her eyes

Some men like the Chinese life

Some men kneel and pray

Am                    G\B C
Ooh well I like women and I like wine

And I've always liked it that way

That old tough man routine up her sleeve

Living and loving, kissing and hugging

Messing with a muscle boy

No superman gonna ruin my plans

Playing with my toys

Rich man sweating in a sauna bath

Poor boy scrubbing in a tub

Washing in a bucket of mud
