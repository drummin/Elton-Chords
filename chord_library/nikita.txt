G     Bm	 C     F\C
Hey Nikita is it cold

C		      G 	   C\G  G
In your little corner of the world

		D7\F#		D\F#  D7
You could roll around the globe

			G	     C\G  G7
And never find a warmer soul to know


     Am	     G\B        C  Dm C
Oh I saw you by the wall

			 G	  C\G  G
Ten of your tin soldiers in a row

			   D7\F#       D\F# D7\F#
With eyes that looked like ice on fire

			  G	      C\G G7
The human heart a captive in the snow


     Am	  G\B	    C	     Dm\C C 	      G		   C\G
Oh Nikita You will never know       anything about my home

     G				     D 	      C\D D7
I'll never know how good it feels to hold you (Oh___!)

	 G	     C\G  G7
Nikita I need you so

      Am  G\B	 C	   Dm\C C 	        G	    C\G
Oh Nikita is the other side       of any given line in time

G				D  
Counting ten tin soldiers in a row  

Em D7\F#   D	       G          Bm  D\B  C#dim  Dsus
Oh no,   Nikita you'll never know


G      Bm	      C  C\F
Do you ever dream of me

C			    G		 C\G G
Do you ever see the letters that I write

			     D    C\D  D7
When you look up through the wire

			G 	       C\G G7
Nikita do you count the stars at night


    Am       G\B      C    Dm\C C
And if there comes a time

			  G	     C\G G
Guns and gates no longer hold you in

			     D7    C\D  D7
And if you're free to make a choice

			       G             C\G G7
Just look towards the west and find a friend

(Oh_____!) Nikita,

Am	 G\B     C        D    G
Counting ten tin soldiers in a row.



*The Instrumental Bridge should be played with single notes in an upper register.
A good effect would be using a trumpet or brass ensemble setting on a synthesizer keyboard, but piano also works.
Follow the recording for the proper notes.
