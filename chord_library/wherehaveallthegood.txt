Am  Gdim\A  C\A Gdim\A  Am  

Am  G\A  Gdim\A  Am  G\A Gdim\A  Am

	Am              Gdim\A C\A    Am
See the changes here on eve-   ry  street

	     Am		   Gdim\A C\A  Am
As time goes marching to a differ-ent beat

       F	   Bb\F C7\F F
Moving on into the restless  age

       Bb\F C7\F F		Em\G
As the kids to-  day find their feet


(Long enough to hold on)

Am		Gdim\A G\A   Am
Young enough to chase  our dreams

	Am	    Gdim\A G\A   Am
We were captured by roman- tic things

	    F		 Bb\F C7\F   F
Touched by love until it made us   cry

	Bb\F   C7\F  F           Em\G
How our hearts could fly without wings


	  	  Dm	          
Oh won't somebody tell me

C\G		   C            G\B   Am
Tell me where have all the good times gone

Am	 G   Dm7
Say that you remember

C\G		   C    G\B           Am
Remember all those good old Four Tops songs

Am        G    Dm7
Won't somebody tell me

E			      Am
Where have all the good times gone

    Gdim\A  C\A Gdim\A  Am  

Am  G\A  Gdim\A  Am  G\A Gdim\A  Am

Am		      Gdim\A C\A Am
Stolen moments in the smo-   ky  room

       Am		   Gdim\A C\A Am
Monday mornings that would come   too soon

       F		 Bb\F C7\F F
Crazy summers that would ne-  ver  end

	 Bb\F C7\F F		Em\G
When the time was  spent loving you


(Yeah we had a good time)


Am		  Gdim\A C\G Am
Some things never seem   to  last

	 Am           Gdim\A C\A Am
Ain't it funny how we missed the past

	 F		 Bb\F  C7\F  F
Love has changed but the clock still turns

	  Bb\F  C7\F  F         Em\G
While the flame still burns for you

(CHORUS)

Am	     C    C
Gone they've gone away

Am	     C    C
Gone they've gone away

Am   G\B     C    Dm Em
Gone they've gone away

F       G    Am E\B
They've gone a- way

      A             Gdim\A C\A Am
It's hard enough to lose   the game

    Am	          Gdim\A C\A Am
And sad to see it played a-  gain

	   F	     Bb\F C7\F F
What makes you happy for  a    while

   F     Bb\F C7\F F	             Em\G
Is gonna make you  smile through the rain

(CHORUS)

Am	     C    C
Gone they've gone away

Am	     C    C
Gone they've gone away

Am   G\B     C    Dm Em
Gone they've gone away

F       G    Am E\B
They've gone a- way

C     C\E F      F    C\E F     C\E  F   F    G     G
Won't you please tell me  where have the good times gone
(REPEAT, FADE)
