Make Me As You Are

Intro: Gm D Eb D  Gm D Eb D

  Gm               D                Bb             Cm       
I cannot hide what I've become it's clear a mother knows her son

    F                Bb                  Eb             D   
And even though your sight grows dim you see the pallor of my skin

    Gm                   D             Bb                Cm 
The blood red eyes sunk in my face you feel the chill in my embrace

     F            Bb                   Cm              D
The Gothic legend of your youth stands here tonight as God's own truth


And from that truth I feel no fear two kinds of death are present here
Mine's the age-old act of dying but yours is like the Phoenix rising
Your mother's frail and feeble husk will soon be nothing more than dust
So let's not dwell on wasted years my time is short, my choice is clear


Bb
Make me as you are

Bb/Ab                               Gsus4          G   
Tear the hands off clocks that tick away my final hours 

                            Cm                        F
I want to rage against the light And leave the sun behind

                            D                   Gm     
I want to feel the path of everlasting youth inside

Eb                   F/Eb            G     Cm/A  G/B  Cm
Take me, give me new life and we'll live beneath the stars

                F      Fm/Ab    Eb      Fsu4  F   Bb
Together and forever I beg you, Make me as    you are

Repeat intro: Gm D Eb D  Gm D Eb D


This cursed gift with which I live I know not if it's mine to give
But out of love I can't refuse With much to gain; nothing to lose
The risk is mine, and if we fail I'll shake the demons by their tails
And spit into the devil's face and say hell's now was damn, this place


I'm still a fledgling in this frame I've only killed when hunger reigned
Death was final in my wake but yes this is the chance we'll take
Oh blessed thoughts of sweet release from nagging nurse, and hovering priest
To rid myself of stoop and cane to breathe without this burning pain

Bb 
Make Me As You Are

Bb/Ab                                Gsus4             G 
Tear the wings off angels that would lift me from your heart

                            Cm                     F
I want to dance beneath the moon and slip into the dark

                          D                     Gm 
I want to feel the night awaken when I leave my mark

Eb                   F/Eb           G      Cm/A  G/B Cm    
Take me, give me new life and we'll live beneath the stars

                 F      Fm/Ab   Eb       Fsus4 F
Together and forever, I beg you Make Me, Make Me,
