Intro: E5


E5
Lady luck and four leaf clovers won't ease this hurt I feel all over.
                                                                    C#5
My life was one special occasion `til your leaving dampened the situation.



CHORUS:
     D5   D#5  E5                                                   C#5   D5-D#5
Well,well,well-standing on shakey ground, ever since you put me down.
E5                                                     C#5   D5-D#5
Standing on shakey ground, ever since you put me down.



E5
My car got repossessed this morning.  Harder times I haven't seen in years.
E5
Girl you better throw me a life preserver -
                                         C#5
     `cause I'm about to drown in my own tears.
