Believe
Elton John/Bernie Taupin

intro:
Gm  Gm/F  Eb  Cm  Dsus4 D (repeat)

Gm                 Gm/F
I believe in love, it's all we got
Eb                            Cm         Dsus4  F
Love has no boundaries, costs nothing to touch
Gm               Gm/F
War makes money, cancer sleeps
Eb                                    Cm           Cm/Bb
Curled up in my father and that means something to me
Ab                      Cm                   Cm/Bb
Churches and dictators, politics and papers
Ab                  Fm7       G7aug5  G
Everything crumbles sooner or later
    Cm Gm/Bb Ab   G7aug5     Cm     Dsus4  F
But love,       I believe in love


I believe in love, it's all we got
Love has no boundaries, no borders to cross
Love is simple, hate breeds
Those who think difference is the child of disease
Father and son make love and guns
Families together kill someone
Without love, I believe in love


Gm           Gm/F
Without love I wouldn't believe
Eb          Cm             Dsus4    D
In anything that lives and breathes
Gm           Gm/F
Without love I'd have no anger
Eb                        Cm
I wouldn't believe in the right to stand here
Ab             Cm
Without love I wouldn't believe
  Ab
I couldn't believe in you
      Fm7                 G7aug5      
And I wouldn't believe in me
G       Cm   Gm/Bb  Ab
Without love 
      G7aug5 Cm   Gm/Bb  Ab
I believe in love
      G7aug5 Cm   Gm/Bb  Ab
I believe in love
      G7aug5 C     G/D   Eb    Fm  Gsus4  G  Cm
I believe in love
