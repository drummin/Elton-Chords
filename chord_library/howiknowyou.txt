   Am              F            G              Am
I grew up in your hometown, at least began to grow.
   F            G                               C
I hadn't got to my first shave before the body blow.
  Dm              C/E           F         G
Egyptians in the courtyard, my family in chains.
     Am              F            Dm/F         E             Am    (Melody: C-B-B-A)
You witnessed our abduction which possibly explains - how I know you.
     F      G     (Melody: B-C-B-C-B-C-B-A)
     How I know you.




   Am                F          G       Am
Before that fateful morning my family enjoyed -
        F           G                G     Gsus    C
     a privileged existence, for my father was  employed.
     Dm           C/E                   F              G
As advisor to the king, no less, which surely rings a bell.
    Am              F            Dm/F          E            Am    (Melody: C-B-B-A)
For as you are his daughter, you probably can tell - how I know you.
     F      G     (Melody: B-C-B-C-B-C-B-A)
     How I know you.



 Am            F                  G        Am
Enough of reminiscence, and such happy memories.
     F            G                G     Gsus     C
The reason why I know you well is really none of these.
     Dm               C/E           F              G
It's just you reek of royalty.  You ooze uncommon grace.
     Am              F           Dm/F          E             Am    (Melody: C-B-B-A)
I'd know you were a princess, in any time and place. Yes, I know you.
F      G   (B-C trill)          Am     (C-B-B-A)  F      G      (B-C trill end in Am)
How I know you.         Yes, I know you.          How I know you.
