Intro: F Eb Bb F }2x

F               C
Caught me a bus early today
F7                      Bb
Hours before my dinner time
F                     C
Packed my case on the early shift
      Eb              Bb
And I left this shack behind
             F        Eb      F
Oh I said I left this shack behind

F Eb Bb F }2x

F             C
You may think I done wrong
    F7                  Bb
The police may think so too
         F                       C
But I'm sick and tired of this crumbling life
           Eb                 Bb
I said I'm doing what I gotta do
                 F           Eb    F
Lord I said I'm doing what I gotta do

F Eb Bb F }2x

chorus:
F                      C
Say goodbye to Rachael Anne
F7                     Bb
Tell her that I had to go
F9                         C9	
Tell her she can follow my tracks if she wants
A7                     Bb
All the way down to El Paso
	 F9          A7   Dm                    Bb  F
Singin' all the way down, all the way down to El Paso

F Eb Bb F }2x

F                C
People there, so I've been told
F7               Bb
Treat you like a man
    F                       C
Who don't creep 'round your house at night
   Eb            Bb
Or mutilate your land
           F    Eb       F
Oh I said, mutilate your land

F Eb Bb F }2x

(repeat chorus)

F Eb Bb F }4x

F             C
Rachael Anne, if you can
F7                   Bb
You'll know where to find me
F                   C
Follow the tracks I left back there
Eb            Bb
All along the highway
            F    Eb       F
Lord I said all along the highway

F Eb Bb F }2x

(repeat chorus)
