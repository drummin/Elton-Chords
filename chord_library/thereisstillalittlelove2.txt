For me in your heart..........
G#m                     F#6
Even though it seems to you
           Emaj7     D#sus  D#7
that we are far apart..........

F#                        B
You can turn your eyes to other guys
F#                 B
Ignore me on the street

G#m                 F#6

     Emaj7         D#sus  D#7
What's on your mind..........
G#m                    F#6
I can read you like a story book
       Emaj7          D#sus  D#7
Do you think I'm blind..........

F#                  B
For every place I seem to be
F#                    B
You seem to be there too
  D              C#m
Standing in the wings of love
    D#sus            D#   D#7
And waiting for your cue, and
