        Bm  E  E7/D 



Am7  /E            /A         /E-/A   Bm   /F#           /B        /F#-/B 
   Oooh, he was a light star              trippin' on a high wire.
Fm7   /C      /F        /C-/F   Ebmaj7  /Bb    /Eb   /Bb-/Eb  
      Bulldog stubborn,                 born  uneven.
B+                       E7   /B   /E   E(addC)/B - E     Am
A classless creature,            a man    for      all   seasons.
/E        /A         /E-/A    Bm       /F#         /B
But don't bet them they can't take him to the very bottom -
 /F#-/B   Fm9   /C       /F      Fm7/C-/F   Gm/Eb  /Bb         /Eb     /Bb-/Eb  
     Be - cause,   they made him                      & they'll waste him.
B+                            E7  /B  /E            /B-/E    Am7                   
   And I don't believe   -           (sigh!) that I wanna   watch them.

B+                  E7             Am    Am7  
   `Cos the fifties shifted out of gear.    Mmm,
D7   /A           /D           G                Am/G      G7     
        He was an idol then,      now - he's an  i - dol here.
C              D/C                Bm                   Em          
      But his face has changed,          he's not the same no more.
A7         /E     /A      B7+                            E7b9 
    And I have to say           that I like the way his   mu-sic sounded before.



He was tight-assed;   Walking on broken glass.
Highly prized in the wallet size.
The number one crush in a schoolgirl's eyes.
But don't pretend that it won't end in the depth of your despair.
You went from lame suits right down to tennis shoes -
     to peanuts from the lion's share.
