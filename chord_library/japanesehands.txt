Intro:  Eb / Bb /Ab     Bb / / /     Eb / Bb /Ab     Bb / / /


   Eb/G                            F/G
Outside I can hear the fireworks beyond the paper walls.
          Eb/G                            F/G                        Dm
Where the symbols painted black and white  -  run together when the rain falls.
        Eb/G                          F/G
And the wind chimes across Kyoto each time the earth moves.
    Eb/G                                 F/G              Dm
Was it the quake that shook me or was it  -  something to do with you?



CHORUS: Eb                  F                       Eb          F
And the hot wind heats the bamboo blinds.  And your almond eyes always shine.
         Bb                      Eb/G
Sitting cool behind your painted fan.
        Db                              Eb
All the secrets of the east conceal the beauty and the beast.
     Bb           Eb   F                   Bb
For tender is the man  -  in her Japanese hands.



Eb/G                                    F/G
Flesh on silk looks different than on a cotton sheet back home.
      Eb/G                                 F/G            Dm
Where no one wears their hair like yours beneath those oriental combs.
              Eb/G                    F/G
And with your thirsty fingers running up and down my spine,
       Eb/G                              F/G           Dm
You forget the western woman when you're sleeping on Kyoto time.


{Repreat Chorus}


        Bb
And the sky explodes.   And the moon grows cold. 
Eb/Bb                          Bb
       To the distant sound of drums.
        Bb                      Ab
And the sky explodes.   And the moon grows cold.
       Cm                               F
As the dragons on the mainland wait to heat the sun.


      Eb/Bb   F/Bb             Bb     Eb/Bb   F/Bb             Bb
CODA:         In her Japanese hands.          In her Japanese hands.
