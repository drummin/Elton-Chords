Don't close the shades I'm scared of the darkness.

I'm cold as a razor blade inches from mad - ness.

Don't let me sleep here - they're all trying to kill me.
Cm/A                          G/B                  B7
I've seen the walls moving.  They've all heard me screaming.  Screaming.

Em                                     G/A
Feed me - Feed my needs and then just leave me.
A                        C/D       D  A/D             Em7
Let me go back where you found me.   `Cause I miss my basement.
                                   G/A                        A7
The sweet smell of new paint, the warmth and the comforts of home.
    B7        B7                      Em/D
So feed me.  Give me my treatment and free me.

My arms are so hungry      -      so feed me.



Em                                      Cmaj7
The room's so distorted and filled with  mad  shadows.
  Bm7         Em7                    G/A     A7
I feel like a carcass - white like a marrow bone.
B7                        Em/D
It all seems so long ago, I remember them laughing.
Cm/A                          G/B                   B7
I heard the ambulance scream.  I saw the red light flashing.  Flashing.
