       Cm                                 Eb/G            Ab
We're caught up in a web, you and I since Crystal came between us.
     Fm                               Cm
The knots of friendship seem to be untied.
                                                          Eb/G             
Ab
And it hurts me most to cheat and that's no lie - she can swing us both 
forever.
        Fm                G7              Cm
In the long run she's the one who must decide.



CHORUS:     Ab        Eb                      Bb
And if she leaves me, handle her with care - don't hurt little Crystal.
            Ab                      Eb            Bb
And if she calls you long distance just be there  -  oh Crystal.
     Cm                                        F
The world is your oyster, you're a pearl - but he's a jewel and my 
friend.
    Ab                    Bb                               Eb
I'm sure that in the end,    Crystal you'll be his little girl.
Fm7  -  Ab  Bb  Eb
Oh,         Crystal!



        Cm                                    Eb/G                Ab
You're stronger than me but I'm sure that the fight would fall to no 
one.
     Fm                                 Cm
The cold hard truth is stronger than us all.

And it breaks my heart to see us go this far -
                Eb/G            Ab
     we're just captives in our separate cells.
        Fm                  G7                 Cm
And without her there's no peace behind these bars.


{Repeat Chorus}

       Crystal                   Crystal.
