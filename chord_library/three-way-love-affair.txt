Loving you was easy

Your love captured my heart

You were always pleasing

D		A
Till you tore us apart

Db		F#m
Said you needed both of us

Bm		E
How could you be so unkind

Db		F#m
Then you traded love for lust

But sooner or later I'm gonna get you

F#m		D		Db
Look out girl 'cause I'm gonna fix you

This time I'm gonna break it up

There won't be any making up

I'm shaking this three-way love affair

Verse 2:
A	       Bm
Sneaking out on Sunday

D		    A
You thought I didn't know

A	         Bm
Well early morning Monday

D		     A
Once more you didn't show

Db	    F#m
Alibis and selfish lies

Bm			   E
Oh I've had my fill of them all

Db		 F#m
You can dry your crying eyes

Bm		      E
I know you're faking, there's no mistaking

F#m		    D		Db
Look out girl your heart might be breaking


Repeat Chorus
