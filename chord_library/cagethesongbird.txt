E

A	     G
Sober in the morning light

D
Things look so much different

	    A      A    E
To how they looked last night

A			  G
A pale face pressed to an unmade bed

     D				  A
Like flags of many nations flying high above her head


A	      E
The cellophane still on the flowers

G  			  D
The telegram still in her hand

A 	          G
As whispers circulate all day

      D				       A
Their back-stage baby princess passed away


	    C#m	      G#m
And you can cage the songbird

    Bm		        F#m
But you can't make her sing

	   C#m	     G#m
And you can trap the free bird

	   Bm		    F#m
But you'll have to clip her wings

	      E    E      E7  E     E     E7  
`Cause she'll soar like a hawk when she flies

E	   D                  E          A 
But she'll dive like an eagle when she dies

G     D    D  A
Ooh!  ooh!


A	    G
Promises of no more lies

     D			
Fell flat upon an empty stage

	   A        E
Before the audience arrived

A			G
A return in time to the cheaper seats

		    D
She never knew what lay beneath

			   A
Just a dated handbill they found between the sheets


A		    E
Let down before the final curtain

G		              D
A shallow heart that left her cold

A		  G
She left in rouge upon the mirror

	  D 		       A
A circled kiss to the faithful fans who'd miss her

(CHORUS)

A     G     D     A
Ooh!  ooh!  ooh!
