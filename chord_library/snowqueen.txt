G  C  G\B  Am  D

       G
You remind me so much

G		   C
Of her when you're walking

      G
Where everything's perfect

G	      C
And nobody's talking


Am		   D
You're a cushion uncrumpled

Bm		      Em
You're a bed that's unruffled

    C
The finest bone china,

A           D
Bone china around


    G
And I believe that the snow queen

G		       C
Lives somewhere in the hills

              G
She's got the world on a string

G			  C
Like white wine when it's chilled


Am		     D
Arms are spread like icicles

Bm	       Em
Upon a frosted cake

    C
The snow queen reigns in warm L.A.

A		      D
Behind the cold black gates


     G
Your talents are tested

G			     C
They're polished and they're shaped

     G
Your talents are wasted

G	     C
On men of no taste


Am	      D
But how about proving

Bm		   Em
That passion means more than

C		     A
A wardrobe of gowns, TV ratings,

          A            D
A fragile waist, and a name

(CHORUS)


    G
And I believe that the snow queen

G		       C
Lives somewhere in the hills

    G
And I believe that the snow queen

G		       C
Lives somewhere in the hills


    G
I believe, I believe, I believe

G			   C
She lives somewhere in the hills.
(REPEAT, FADE)
