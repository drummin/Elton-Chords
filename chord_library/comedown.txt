Am              D
in the quite silent seconds i
Am               D
i turned off the light switch and i
Cmaj7          Bm7
i came down to meet you in the 
Dm            E    D/F#      E/G#
half ligt the moon left while a
Am                 D
a cluster of night jar sang some
Am    D
songs out of tune
Cmaj7       Bm7
a mantle of bright light
Dm                  E   D/F#  E/G#  
shone down from the room


Fmaj7        Em7
come down in time
Dm7     Cmaj7
i still hear her say
F        Dm7   Dm
so clear in my ear 
            Cmaj7
like it was today
F            Ab
come down in time
        C                Am7
was the message she gave to me
F            Ebmaj7       D             F    C  D5
come down in time and ill meet you half way


Am   D   Am7   D (to coda last time)


well i dont know if i should have
heard her as yet but a 
true love like hers is a
a hard love to get and ive
walked most all the way and i
aint heard her call and im
im getting to thinking
if shes comming at all


Am7         D
there are women and women 
Am7  D              Cmaj7
some hold you tight while
               Bm7
some leave you counting the
Am7          B5
stars in the night
