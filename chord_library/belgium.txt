Just Like Belgium
Music By: Elton John
Lyrics: Gary Osborne
Album: The Fox

Intro: D - Em - C - G

G				           C
Remember Belgium and the Brussels Museum
                       D                         G
Where we piled on the front steps like stray cavaliers
G						C
Our code of living meant little to others
			  D				  G
The few francs we saved bought some cheap souvenirs

C				       D			G		C
But the red lights where the catfights make it just like Belgium
G				  Em				F   D
See us face down on the floor of another cheap barroom
C			    D			 G          D
Streetwalkers sweet talk you out of your spare change
           G			  D			C                G
And your sweet madame makes it seem just like Belgium, just like Belgium

G						 C
Just like a hustler when they look attractive
	         D				   G
It's nothing more than a slap on the back
G							  C
The price tag of being just a little bit different
			 D					G
The first rule to learn is to keep your own distance
