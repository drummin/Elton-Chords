G                Dm(4)/F    C/E                  G
Lately I've been thinking    how much I miss my lady
   Bm7             Em  G   C                 G
Amoreena's in the cornfield brightening the daybreak
              Dm(4)/F      C/E                  G
Living like a lusty flower, running through the grass for hours
Bm7                 Em  G7  C                    G
Rolling through the hay        like a puppy child


D                     A7/C#
And when it rains the rain falls down
C               G
Washing out the cattle town
D              A7/C#        C        G
And she's far away somewhere in her eiderdown
Bdim               Esus4   E
And she dreams of crystal streams
    Am        C7/G   F
Of days gone by when we would lean
Fm7/Eb                          Dsus4   D
Laughing fit to burst upon each other


D7    G               Dm(4)/F   C/E             G
I can see you sitting eating     apples in the evening
     Bm7                Em           G
The fruit juice flowing slowly, slowly, slowly
C                       G
Down the bronze of your body
              Dm(4)/F      C/E                  G
Living like a lusty flower, running through the grass for hours
Bm7                 Em  G7  C                    G
Rolling through the hay        like a puppy child


D                     A7/C#
And when it rains the rain falls down
C               G
Washing out the cattle town
D              A7/C#        C        G
And she's far away somewhere in her eiderdown
Bdim               Esus4   E
And she dreams of crystal streams
    Am        C7/G   F
Of days gone by when we would lean
Fm7/Eb                          Dsus4   D
Laughing fit to burst upon each other


      G            Dm(4)/F  C/E                      G
Oh if only I could nestle     in the cradle of your cabin
    Bm7              Em   G       C                G
My arms around your shoulders the windows wide and open
                         Dm(4)/F  C/E                 G
While the swallow and the sycamore are playing in the valley
      Bm7          Em    G7   C                G
Oh I miss you Amoreena like a king bee misses honey


G                Dm(4)/F    C/E                  G
Lately I've been thinking    how much I miss my lady
   Bm7             Em  G   C                 G
Amoreena's in the cornfield brightening the daybreak
              Dm(4)/F      C/E                  G
Living like a lusty flower, running through the grass for hours
Bm7                 Em  G7  C                    G     D/G  G
Rolling through the hay        like a puppy child
