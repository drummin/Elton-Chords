Eb		  Bb     Eb		Bb
There's a calm surrender to the rush of day

Eb		   Bb		Cm	       F
When the heat of a rolling wind can be turned away

Eb	     Bb	     Eb		    Bb
An enchanted moment, and it sees me through

Eb		     Gm7	      Cm	      F
It's enough for this restless warrior just to be with you


    Bb	    F\A      Gm     Eb
And can you feel the love tonight

Bb    Eb    Em7   F  Bb\F  F
It is where we are

Eb	   Bb        Gm7  Bb\F Eb
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer

Cm   Bb\D Cm\Eb Gm6\E   F  Bb\F  F
That we   got   this far

    Bb	    F\A      Gm     Eb
And can you feel the love tonight

Bb	 Eb   Em7     F  Bb\F  F
How it's laid to rest

Eb	   Bb       Gm    Bb\D Eb
It's enough to make kings and  vagabonds

  Eb    Em7 F	     Eb\Bb  Bb
Believe the very best

Bb  F\A  Gm  Bb\F  Eb  Bb\D  Cm  Bb\D  Eb  F


Eb		   Bb	    Eb		 Bb
There's a time for everyone if they only learn

Eb		    Bb	       Cm	       F
That the twisting kaleidoscope moves us all in turn

Eb		    Bb	   Eb		  Bb
There's a rhyme and reason to the wild outdoors

Eb		       Gm7		    Cm		       F
When the heart of this star-crossed voyager beats in time with yours


(CHORUS)

Eb	   Bb       Gm    Bb\D Eb
It's enough to make kings and  vagabonds

  Eb    Em7 F	     Eb\Bb  Bb
Believe the very best
