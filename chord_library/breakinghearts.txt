      Gb                       Ebm7
They used to say that boys are tough as nails.
         F7                                Bbm   Ab
In every way he keeps his heart as guarded as a jail.
                 Ebm               F/Eb
Now things have changed, I feel so old.
     Bb/D   Eb                 Ab               Db
Like any    girl could drag my heart across the coals.
      Gb                  Ebm7
I was always there in the thick of things.
         F7                           Bbm   Ab
I always had the heart of every woman on a string.
           Ebm                F/Eb
The danger zone shone from my eyes.
    Bb/D       Eb           Ab               Db
It seemed like every inch I gained became a mile.


CHORUS:
A7  *  B/A      A7       D                     D+
           It's not the night reaching in and touching me.
                G                            Gm
It's just that breaking hearts ain't what it used to be.
               D                         B7
It seems that time has killed that cruel streak in me -
          Em7                          G/A     A
     and breaking hearts ain't what it used to be
G/A       A7/C#      D                    D+
     It's  not  the light shining in and catching me.
                G                            Gm
It's just that breaking hearts ain't what it used to be.
              D              B7
But time has come and cast a spell on me.
     Em7                          A7      D
And breaking hearts ain't what it used to be.


Now I know what lonely means. I used to give so little and gain everything.
The darkest part of every day -
     is the shadow of another girl as she turns and walks away.
Can't say I blame them all for being hurt.
After all, I treated each and every one like dirt.
Who wants a heart that's never home?
I face the facts and lock myself into a life alone.


        Em7              F#7              Bm    
CODA:  Breaking hearts. Breaking hearts. Breaking hearts. 
        E7                Em7                  A7      D
       Breaking hearts     -     ain't what it used to be.
