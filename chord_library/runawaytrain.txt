          Gm
There's a hungry road I can only hope's
      Cm
Gonna eat me up inside
          D#               D7
There's a drifting spirit coming clean
       Cm                Gm
In the eye of a lifelong fire
     Gm
Tell Monday I'll be around next week
    Cm
I'm running ahead of my days
       D#                   D7
In the shotgun chance that scattered us
              Cm          Gm
I've seen the error of my ways
      D#    D7        Gm
Oh oh oh,      Oh oh oh

VERSE 2:
Well we've wrapped ourselves in golden crowns
Like sun gods spitting rain
Found a way home written on this map
Like red dye in my veins
In the hardest times that come around
The fear of losing grows
I've lost and seen the world shut down
It's a darkness no one knows
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh

CHORUS:
         Bb
And I've poured out the pleasure and dealt with the pain
F                     D7
Standing in a station waiting in the rain
    D#                         Bb
I'm starting to feel a little muscle again
            F                     Bb
But love is lost like a runaway train
       Bb
Oh I'm out of control and out of my hands
    F                            D7
I'm tearing like a demon through no man's land
D#                          Bb
Trying to get a grip on my life again
             F                       Bb
Nothing hits harder than a runaway train
