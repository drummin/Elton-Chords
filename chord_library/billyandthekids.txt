C
Nothing looks as bad

E
After staying up all night

Am
And the cruel words that cut you down

D7\F#
I never meant to write

		     C
And what came out as anger

		         F
Oh was a lack of self control

C\E		F
Billy won't you hold me

C\E  F C\G  C\G C
Once before you go


Em7  F  C\G  C

C
Clever lies keep coming

E
Some men never change

Am
I'm a hand that's raised in anger

D7\F#
The blow that causes pain

		    C
But I just can't be trusted

		    F
with a bottle and a child

C\E	      F
Billy it's no wonder

    C\E F    C\G   C
You say I've never tried


	       C
Oh so leave me now

	       C
Oh don't turn around

	 G
It's the best thing you ever did

	 G7		G7
But it's hard for me to say goodbye

	 C
To Billy and the kids


	       C
Oh so leave me now

	       C7\E
Oh don't turn around

	 C\E		     D7\F#
It's the best thing you ever did

	 C\G		G
But it's hard for me to say goodbye

	 C	     Em7  F  C\G  C
To Billy and the kids

Em7  F  C\G  C


C  E  Am  D7\F#

		     C
And what came out as anger

		         F
Oh was a lack of self control

C\E		F
Billy won't you hold me
