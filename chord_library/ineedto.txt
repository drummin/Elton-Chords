I Need to Turn To
by: Elton John and Bernie Taupin

Intro: Em  D  G  A  Am  Em  D  Em

Em            D       G	       A
You're not a ship to carry my life
         Am           Em      D           Em
You are nailed to my love in many lonely nights
      Em                D           G            A
I've strayed from the cottages and found myself here
      Am                   Em      D       Em
For I need your love your love protects my fears

       G                       
And I wonder sometimes and I know I'm unkind
       B7          Em          D        D/F#
But I need you to turn to when I act so blind
G                     	       
And I need you to turn to when I lose control
	 B7                     Em            D	  
You're my guardian angel who keeps out the cold

          Em             D        G         A
Did you paint your smile on, well I said I knew
         Am         Em         D         Em
That my reason for living was for loving you
       Em          D          G           A
We're related in feeling but you're high above
Am      Em              D               Em
You're pure and you're gentle with the grace of a dove

Outro: Em  D  G  A  Am  Em  D  E
