	G
There's some things I don't have now
Bb
Some things I don't talk about
      C				    G
These things are between myself and I
      G\F	      C\E   G
In my thick skull the joker hides 

	G
There's consequences I'm scared to taste
Bb
Cold hard truths I can't face
      C				  G
These days are different than the past
  G\F			  C\E	       G
Reflections change in the looking glass 

    Dm\F	 C\E	      C\E	   G
And everywhere I look there's something to learn
  F	    	       C\E	       G
A sliver of truth from every bridge we burn
  Dm\F	    C\E	     C\E	 G
A hatful of quarters and a naked song
      F		 C\E	     D		D
Don't answer the question of where we belong

	 G
How come birds 
		    F		  G
Don't fall from the sky when they die?
	 Bb
How come birds
		  C
Always look for a quiet place to hide
      G
These words
		   F	    G
Can't explain what I feel inside?
     Bb		    C		   G
Like birds I need a quiet place to hide

These independent moves I make
This confidence I try to fake
You can hear the beating of my heart
But not a feather falling in the dark

And everything I hear never makes any sense
Another old prophet perched on the fence
A cupful of pencils and a self help guru
Don't answer the question of what I am to you

     Bb		    C		   G
Like birds I need a quiet place to hide
     Bb		    C		   G
Like birds I need a quiet place to hide
