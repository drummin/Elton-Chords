Intro: G D F C

G           D        G          C
Grey London morning, wet London streets

G           D       Em          C
Rain on the window, wind in the trees

G               D           Em            C
It's my time to write, it's your time to calL

G                        D            F             C D F C
There's something about distance that gets to us all


Dark clouds above me, little people below
All walk with a purpose with someplace to go
It's my place to paint my own selfish scene
On this cold lonely canvas, it's just the weather and me

G

B          Em
And latitude

C                G        D            G
Fold back the morning and bring on the night

            Am   G
There's an alien moon

      A                           D
That hangs between darkness and light

B      Em      c        G
Latitude between me and you

          B                Em
You're a straight line of distance

   C             G            D
A cold strech of black across blue

F C
Latitude


G D F C G D F C


Cracks in the sidewalks, dogs on the run
An old poster reading "Give us your sons"
Window frames capture moments in time
But latitude captures the heart and the mind
