C      C4\E        F	   Eb
Nobody left in the airport lounge

Bb
They cleaned the ashtrays

     F		Eb
TV's just wound down

		      F
I've got to wait till morning

		     Eb
I've got to last the night

	  Db
I've only got one book

	  Bbm		    C
To see me through my flight


		  F
But when I get to Paris

		    Eb Db
We'll paint all our portraits

		    Ab
In brush-strokes of yellow

		 Eb
And christen the canvas

		 Abm
The left bank is crying

	      Bbm
For colour to crown it

		   Db     Gb\Db Db
Like the roof of a palace

		   Ab
We'll drink in the amber

	      Gb
When I get to Paris


C	     C4\E    F		       Eb
You were the best of Montmartre Street life

Bb
You signed the tablecloth

    F       Eb
Art has its price

		F
It's so hard to hold on

		     Eb
To the ghost of your breed

	   Db
It takes ambition

	    Bbm		     C
To call the colours you need

(CHORUS)

		      F
I've got to wait till morning

I've only got one book

	  Bbm		    C
To see me through my flight

Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris
