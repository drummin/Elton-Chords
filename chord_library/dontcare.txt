D  C G  D  C G

      D
I got feet sticking out of my shoes

      D
I got heat more than I can use

      G                      D
I got love, I got all I need

      D 
I got soles that are wearing thin

      D
I got holes where the rain gets in

      G                            D
I got you and that's enough for me


         Bm4  G       D
I don't care, I don't care

         Bm4  G       D
I don't care, I don't care

         Bm4  G       D
I don't care, I don't care

         C   G                       D  C G  D C G 
I don't care, long as I got your love


D  
Clothes that are falling apart

        D
I got a car that refuses to start

           G                    D
I got love, I do the best I can

      D
I got bills piling up in the hall

      D
I got paint peeling off the wall

      G                    D
I got you, I'm a happy man
