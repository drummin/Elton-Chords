Verse1: Gb/Db		Db        
        Rules and regulations
	    Gb/Db		  Db	     Ab
        Are real estate of things I've left behind.
	Gb/Db		      Db
        Flights are always leaving,
	Gb/Db		  Db	    Ab
        Silver wings unfolding on a dime,
	Ab-Fm7-Ebm7
        But I won't forget to tell you,
	[C Db]			Fm  Bbm
        If I could reconnect the line.
	  Gb		    Db/Gb
        I never really knew you,
	         Ab			    Db	 (Gb/Db)  Db  
	But come back, I'd like to find the time.


Verse2: 
	Gb/Db		Db 
	Drugs and consequences
	    Gb/Db		       Db     Ab 
        And ferris wheels just took us up and down.
	Gb/Db		      Db  
        Fights were always brewing,
	    Gb/Db		 Db    Ab   	
        Two perfect understudies for a clown.
	   Ab-Fm7-Ebm7  
        If I could piece it all together,
				    Fm  Bbm  
  	Or maybe find you through a friend.
	       Gb		  Db/Gb
	Last I heard it was St. Louis,
	      Ab			 Db	(Gb/Db)  Db
	But I wish that it was Mandalay again.


Chorus:      Ab
	Come back, I'd like to find the time,
		Gb			Db
	Plant a seed and raise a little Cain.
	     Bbm		 Ab		F   Bbm
	Come back, we'll throw a rope around the moon,
		Gb		  Ab        A    Db
	And pretend that we're in Mandalay again.


Verse3: 
	Gb/Db		Db 
	Fuel and information
	    Gb/Db		  Db       Ab 
        Are siamese twins that poison everything.
	Gb/Db		      Db
        Lies that left us drowning,
	Gb/Db		  Db       Ab 
        Rumor that burned like gasoline.
	     Ab-Fm7-Ebm7 
        I could have read you like a book,
				       Fm  Bbm
  	But, instead, I acted dumb and blind.
	      Gb		  Db/Gb
	I was younger then, and foolish.
	     Ab			 Db	(Gb/Db)  Db
	Come back, I'd like to find the time.

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge: 
	      Bbm			 Ab
	If it wasn't in the afterglow of wine,
	       Gb			Db/F
	Or the chatter of some European girl,
		 Bbm				 Ab
	I'd have understood that after all these years,
		   Gb				   Ebm/Gb
	There were those who chose to separate our worlds,
	Gb	     Ab	    (Db/Ab)  Ab
	Separate our worlds.

Instrumental:
	
	(Repeat Verse)

(Repeat Chorus)


Outro:
	       Gb		  Ab        A    Db
	And pretend that we're in Mandalay again.
 	         Gb		    Ab        A    Db
	We'll pretend that we're in Mandalay again.
