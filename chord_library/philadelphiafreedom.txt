I used to be a rolling stone

Bb
You know if the cause was right

    C7 		      Eb     C7     Bb   F
I'd leave to find the answer on the road

  Bb			
I used to be a heart beating for someone

Bb
But the times have changed

C7 		   Eb	   C7	     Bb
The less I say the more my work gets done


	 Eb		       Ab\Eb Eb       Bb
`Cause I live and breathe this Philadelphia freedom

         Eb  		Ab\Eb      Eb         Bb
From the day that I was born I've waved the flag

Ab 			     G7             Cm   
Philadelphia freedom took me knee-high to a man.

Ab7          G7		      G7    Gb         Eb
Yeah gave me peace of mind my daddy never had


   Bb				 Eb    Bb\D
Oh Philadelphia freedom shine on me, I love you

        Cm		  Dm7	      E7        Am7    D7
Shine a light through the eyes of the ones left behind

Bb
If you choose to you can live your life alone

Bb
Some people choose the city

     C7		       Eb       C7     Bb    F
Some others choose the good old family home

Bb
I like living easy without family ties

Bb			         C7 
Till the whippoorwill of freedom zapped me

Eb      C7            Bb
Right between the eyes

(CHORUS)

Shine a light won't you shine a light
