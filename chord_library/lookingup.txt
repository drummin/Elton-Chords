LOOKING UP - ELTON JOHN

INTRO
A - - G D

VERSE
A
Figuring out where I went wrong
    F#m        Em7                D
The script not followed, then was awfully long
A        Bm7        A/C#   F#m
Too much pluck, too little of
    D                        A
The acting right, not acting up
  A
I wore the world upon my back
       F#m                Em7        D
Though someone else could meet, pick up the slack
A      Bm7   A/C#    F#m
Just because I could say
     D                     A
It's my life, do things my way

CHORUS
    D
Now I'm looking up more than I look down
    A                                D     A
The view's a whole lot better second time around
D
Too much of me was hidden in the shadows
  Bm            A/C#    D                 E7
I looked up and felt my feet lift off the ground

A - - G D


VERSE
A
Color a lot with a broader stroke
    F#m      Em7           D
The laughter comes as easy as the jokes
A   Bm        A/C#      F#m
Nowadays, I'm thinking 'bout
D                      A
Time is wasted looking back

CHORUS
    D
Now I'm looking up more than I look down
    A                                D     A
The view's a whole lot better second time around
D
Too much of me was hidden in the shadows
  Bm            A/C#    D                 E7
I looked up and felt my feet lift off the ground

INTERLUDE
G                       D
 You drop a bucket in a well
A                        E
 It's dark and deep down there
Em                 D/F#
 Crank the handle, bring it up
    G              D/E E
The water, crystal clear
D/E - - E

A - - G D


CHORUS
    D
Now I'm looking up more than I look down
    A                                D     A
The view's a whole lot better second time around
D
Too much of me was hidden in the shadows
  Bm            A/C#    D                 E7
I looked up and felt my feet lift off the ground
