Verse 1
      E
Every breath is a prayer of some kind
          B        
I breathe in, I breathe out, I just breathe
    C#m                  A     E
And you're so well, blue wonderful
     B
Blue wonderful to me

     E            
Like swimming in your eyes
       B 
I dive in, I dive deep, I just swim
         C#m               A     E
I lose myself in you, blue wonderful
     B         E
Blue wonderful again

Chorus
          C#m            A          E
Don't you know where you go? I will follow
        C#m         A           E
In your footsteps I find my own feet
  Bm/F#         A         G
Addicted like I am to the blues
F#m                             B
Kind of blue of all the blues I need

Verse 2
      E
Yesterday did someone else's song
         B 
In sixty-five summertime, don't let go
       C#m                 A     E
Long before you came, blue wonderful
         B
The blue wonderful I know

           E
Ain't just something I just left behind
       B
In the past, far away, used to be
         C#m               A     E
But your presence, my blue wonderful
     B            E
Blue wonderful to me

Chorus 

C#m          A              E
Go where you want, when you want to
     C#m           A             E
Just don't let the wind tear you free
Bm/F#            A                     G
Stick around the light that brings you home
      F#m                       B
Don't ever hang around with the breeze
