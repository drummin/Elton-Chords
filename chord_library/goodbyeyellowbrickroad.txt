I should have stayed on the farm

I should have listened to my old man

So goodbye yellow brick road

	  Bb		  F    C\E
Where the dogs of society howl

You can't plant me in your penthouse

I'm going back to my plough

Back to the howling old owl in the woods

Hunting the horny back toad

I bet that'll shoot down your plane

      Eb	 Bb        C         C\E
It'll take you a couple of vodka and tonics

   F
To set you on your feet again

Maybe you'll get a replacement

There's plenty like me to be found

Eb       Bb     C            C\E
Mongrels    who ain't got a penny

F  		     C        C\E    F   Db  Db  Eb  Eb 
Sniffing for tidbits like you     on the ground

Ab  Cm\G  Fm  Ab\Eb  Fdim\B  C  C\E  
Ah!_________         Ah!______
