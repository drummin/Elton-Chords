THE ANGEL TREE (John/Taupin)

    G               A7
The angel tree has grown so high
         C                 G
And its roots are planted deep
                  A7
Never climb that willow
             C              G
'Cause its trunk is awful steep
          Am      Bm     Em   D7
Yeah the trunk is awful steep...

 G           F
Seven miles south of the city
C/E             G
Way on a windy hill
      C                       G
The whistling branches of the angel tree
     A7                  Am7  D7
Are calm at the evening still...

 G                F
Magical coolness comes the breeze
        C/E                   G
As the leaves drop freely at will
       C                      G
And strange things happen to people
       A7              Am7  D7
Who go on to the windy hill...

    G               A7
The angel tree has grown so high
         C                 G
And its roots are planted deep
                  A7
Never climb that willow
             C              G
'Cause its trunk is awful steep
          Am      Bm     Em   D7
Yeah the trunk is awful steep...

Bm
Men down here, had gone up to there
    Em
And rested underneath her bough
Bm
They slept long, what is wrong
      A7             D   D7
They never woke up again...

    G               A7
The angel tree has grown so high
         C                 G
And its roots are planted deep
                  A7
Never climb that willow
             C              G
'Cause its trunk is awful steep
          Am      Bm     Em   D7
Yeah the trunk is awful steep...

G              A7
La la la la la la la la
      C           G
la la la la la la la (Repeat & Fade)
