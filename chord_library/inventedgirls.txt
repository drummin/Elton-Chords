intro: C  F/C | C F/C | C F/C | C F/C



Am                      
The mother of invention
Eb/Bb
made it good for me
Bb
Tighter in the rear
F
Longer in the seam
Am
Kicked out yards of leather
Eb/Bb
Wrapped around her waist
Bb
Trimmed it to perfection
F
And left a little space

F/C 			C
Yeah they got competition now
Eb/Bb
All across the world
F/C             C
But there ain't been no looking back
Eb/Bb
Since God invented girls


Db						DbMaj7	Ab
Now I know what Brian Wilson meant
Db
Every time I step outside
Db
I see what Heaven sent
Gb
There may be seven wonders
Bb		Ab/C Bb7
Created for this world
Ebm
But one is all we need
Ab							Db
Since God invented girls

C  F/C | C F/C | C F/C | C F/C

Am					
Higher on the heel
Eb/Bb
paler than pure cream
Bb
Leaner on the sidewalk
F
Cutting through the steam
Am
After claws and feathers
Eb/Bb
He took skin and bone
Bb
Shaped it like an hourglass
F
And made the angels moan
F 				C
Oh here's a little heat boys
Eb/Bb
To straighten out them curls
F/C             C
Now there ain't been no angels round
Eb/Bb
Since God invented girls


Db						DbMaj7	Ab
Now I know what Brian Wilson meant
Db
Every time I step outside
Db
I see what Heaven sent
Gb
There may be seven wonders
Bb		Ab/C Bb7
Created for this world

But one is all we need
Ab						Db
