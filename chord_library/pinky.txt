Pinky
by: Elton John

A - E/A - D/A - A

A				
I don't want to wake you
Bm			E	         D	  A
But I'd like to tell you that I love you
		 C#m		   F#m		       
That the candlelight fell like a crescent
D          A/C# 	      Bm  E
Upon your feather pillow

A
For there's more ways than one
Bm			E	         D	  A
And the ways of the world are a blessing
	   C#m    
For when Pinky's dreaming
     F#m             D      
She owes the world nothing
           A/C# 	             Bm  E
And her silence keeps us guessing

Bm					E
Pinky's as perfect as the Fourth of July
Bm					E
Quilted and timeless, seldom denied
D					 A/C#   B
The trial and the error of my master plan
E						D		 A/C#	   C   D/B
Now she rolls like the dice in a poor gambler's hands

A
You don't want to tell me
Bm			E	         D	  A
But somehow you've guessed that I know
	   C#m             F#m       
Oh when dawn came this morning
			D                      A/C# 	          Bm  E
You discovered a feeling that burned like a flame in your soul

A
For there's toast and honey
Bm				E		D  A	
And there's breakfast in bed on a tray
	C#m		F#m
Oh it's ten below zero
	      D		A/C#	   Bm			E
And we're about to abandon our plans for the day
