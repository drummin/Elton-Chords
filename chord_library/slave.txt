There's a  river  run-ning  sweat  right  through  our  land, through our land.

Driven by a man  with a bullwhip  in  his hand, in his hand.

And I've taken just  as  much as  I   can   stand (I can stand).

We've got to free our brothers from the   shackles - 
D7            C   G Am7    G    Em  G       
yeah, if we  can, if we   can.



Most nights I have to watch my woman cry - oh she cries.
Every day I watch the colonel smile - oh he smiles.
His painted ladies riding in from town - in from town.
I swear one day I'm gonna burn the whore house to the ground, 
     G  Am7    G       G  D 
     to the  ground.




Em       C           G                     D7(+9)    D7
Slave!   Slave!   To fight the violence we  must  be brave.
Em                    C                  Em/G - /E - /D -/B - /A - /G - /E
Hold on strong to the love God gave.     Slave.


There's a rumour of a war that's yet to come
That may free our families and our sons
It may lay green lands to barren wastes
The price of release is a bitter blow to face
