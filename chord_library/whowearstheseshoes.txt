intro:
G  D  G  Bm  G  D  G

G         Bm
There's a light on in your window
          Em
There's a shadow on the street
       D                      A
Two silhouettes tell me it's over
           Em
The shadow knows the shadow's me
        Bm
I won't crawl or cause you trouble
                Em
Well that's the last thing I'll ever do
    F#m7                G7
But before I leave your life completely
F#7                     Bm     Em         Bm  Em
Tell me who wears these shoes, darling

Em             Bm
Lord knows the days just get longer
                em
The nights grow cold with you on my mind
      D                    A
And I feel like an old jukebox
            Em
Playing the same song all the time
            Bm
If these crazy dreams don't kill me
               Em
It's more than I can take from you
            F#7                G7
Not knowing where or when I'll see you
            F#7                     Bm
Not knowing darling who wears these shoes
                 
                   D
My friends all say don't got to pieces
             A/C#
I say that's fine but if I lose
          Em
I want to know who's in my foot steps
                               F#7
I want to know who wears these shoes
               D
My friends all think I must be crazy
          A/C#
I see the facts but if it's true
          Bm                   G
I want to know who's in my footsteps
          Em   D/F#  G     A            Bm      Em  Bm  Em
I want to know who   wears these shoes, darling

              G
Oh and it's a chilling feeling
       A
When I can't see him
          D
What do I do
                D   Em D/F#
When I face the two of you
              G
Oh and it's a chilling feeling
       A
When I can't see him
          D
What do I do
                D   Em D/F#
When I face the two of you

G  
Come on girl, ive got nothing to lose,
        D 
I wanna know, I wanna know who wears these shoes.
G 
Come on girl, ive got nothing to lose,
        Bm
I wanna know, I wanna know who wears these shoes. (repeat to fade)
