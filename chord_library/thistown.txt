It's closing time the boys are all together at the bar

F
Staring in their glasses

			  Cm
Looks like another layoff at the yard.


Cm
Yesterday I heard union hall come down

		   F
They hit it with a wrecking ball

				 Cm
And they try but nothing changes in this town


Eb
Cap in hand stood in line

     Bb\D			     F
Your family ties are the chains that bind

    Eb
The endless wheel goes round and round

Bb\D                                F    G
Chances are you'll never leave this town

Cm\G  G     Cm
Oh    oh no


       Cm
Like a river now the empty streets are flooded out with rain

     F
It's falling on the playground

              			   Cm
While the kids get wet playing the same old games


Cm
Locked away so many things remind them of war

             F
They tap the pavement with their canes

			   Cm
The good old days ain't so good no more

(CHORUS)

Cm  Cm  Cm  Cm  F

			  Cm
Looks like another layoff at the yard.

Cm  Cm  Cm  Cm  F

				 Cm
And they try but nothing changes in this town

(CHORUS)


Eb 	     Bb\D
Cap in hand, stood in line,

F
Oh your family's got the chains that bind.
