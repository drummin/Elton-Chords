Intro: Db  Ebm7 Db Db/Ab Ab

Db  Ebm7 Db Db/Ab Ab

             Db
Oh, it’s carnival night

                   Gb                           Ab        
And they’re stringing the lights around you

F/A                 Bbm
Hanging paper angels

             Ebm                    Ab 
Painting little devils on the roof


           Db  
Oh the furnace wind

       Gb              Ab                     Fm    
Is a flickering of wings about your face

       Fm/C    Bbm  
In a cloud of incense

            Ebm                              Ab
Yea, it smells like Heaven in this place



Ab/C   Gb
I can’t eat, can’t sleep

                    Ab                                  Fm
Still I hunger for you when you look at me

        Gb             Bbm
That face, those eyes

            Ab                          Ab/C
All the sinful pleasures deep inside



            Db                    Ab                         Bbm                 
Fm  
Tell me how, you know now, the ways and means of getting in

                        Gb
Underneath my skin,

                      Ab                       Db 
Oh you were always my original sin

                  Db                   Ab                Bbm         Fm
And tell me why, I shudder inside, every time we begin

                         Gb 
This dangerous game

                      Ab                       Bbm
Oh you were always my original sin


Ebm7  Db Db/Ab Ab  Db Ebm7 Db Db/Ab Ab


(Same as verse 1)
A dream will fly
The moment that you open up your eyes
A dream is just a riddle
Ghosts from every corner of your life


(Same as verse 2)
Up in the balcony
All the Romeo’s are bleeding for your hand
Blowing theater kisses
Reciting lines they don’t understand

I can’t eat, can’t sleep
Still I hunger for you when you look at me
That face, those eyes
All the sinful pleasures deep inside

Tell me how, you know now, the ways and means of getting in
Underneath my skin, 
Oh you were always my original sin
And tell me why, I shudder inside, every time we begin 
This dangerous game

                      Ab                       Bbm  Ab (Repeat Chorus)
Oh you were always my original sin

Tell me how, you know now, the ways and means of getting in
Underneath my skin, 
Oh you were always my original sin
And tell me why, I shudder inside, every time we begin 
This dangerous game

                      Ab                       Bbm
Oh you were always my original sin

Fine: Ebm7  Db Db/Ab Ab
Db Ebm7 Db Db/Ab Ab
Db Ebm7 Db Db/Ab (Strings fade out)
