D                               A
   Blew the dust out of the cor   ners
G                                   Bm
   Threw some dead wood on the fire
D                     A
   Tuned the radio to silence
G                                 D   A/C#
   Watched the evening sun expire
Bm                                F#m
   Should have called you up this morning
G                         Em
   But I'm such a fool at times
D                                A
   I still search my shaving mir   ror
C          G                       D
   Looking for your face with mine

chorus:
         G                  A
   And I can't stay alone tonight
G                           D
   Can't let another day go by
          Bm
Why is it always this way
Em                         A
Time never seems to really fly
    G                          A
And time is never really on my side
      G                       F#m   Bm
And I can't stay alone tonight
Em                                   A
Things have to change and they might
      G          A            D
But I can't stay alone tonight

repeat intro

D                             A
   Chalk up one more crazy no   tion
G                           Bm
   Imagination running wild
D                         A
   But if I needed confir ma tion
G                                    D   A/C#
   I would have gone that extra mile
Bm                               F#m
   You're the last chance on the highway
G                           Em
   I'm that open stretch of road
D                              A
   You're the diner in my rear - view
C            G                  D
   A cup of coffee getting cold

repeat chorus

Bb                          Dm
Bruised in this cold war of words
              C                    F
We've come undone two loose ends alone
         Bb                         Dm
Possessed   by that curse you've endured
                 Edim                        Asus4  A
The spell that I cast couldn't make you come home

repeat chorus

outro:

Em7                                  A
Things have to change and they might.
      G           A           D
But I can't stay alone tonight.
