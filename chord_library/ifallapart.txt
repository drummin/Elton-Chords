    C           /D-/E   Bb/C                     Bb/D
Without you           I no longer swim upstream.
F/A                              Ab7
Where are you when I try to fill  -  the spaces in between?
C              C/G   /D-/E    Bb/C
The red letter days            -  and all the pain,
    F/A                        Ab7
And while I remain shipwrecked  -  everything has changed.



CHORUS:
      C                                                   E/B    E
And I fall apart - with this threat of indecision hanging in my heart.
     E/B              Am     Am/G           D/F#
This house can get so lonely   -   when the day grows dark.
        F              Ab                 G7
And it seems to be the night time when I fall apart.


C                          /D-/E   Bb/C                   Bb/D
Can't you tell the shadows    -    no longer comfort me?
F/A                                Ab7
I don't feel the need to cling to   -   anyone I see.
C                    C/G     /D-/E  Bb/C
This fool's suffered gladly    -    each and every day.
  F/A                      Ab7
I don't wish to reconsider.   I wish they'd stay away.


{Repeat Chorus}


Ab                    Db/Ab
I've no care to count   -   the stares that pity me.
Ab/Eb                    Gb
I'll wash your hurt away just you wait and see.
Fdim                         Bdim
For every rose you give her, I'll give her three.
    F               Ab                  G
But in the meantime I'll just wish that she was me.
