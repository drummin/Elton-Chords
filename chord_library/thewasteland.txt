Gm                   Gm/F    Eb                  Eb/D
Some days I think           it's all a dream

Cm                                F                      D/F#
The things I've done, the places that I've been

Gm                 Gm/F  Eb
This life of mine       seems surreal at times

              Cm                     D/F#                Gm
Wasted days and nights in someone else's mind

Gm Cm C7m/Bb

Could it be I'm not for real
I slap my face to check out how I feel
It's hostages to prove it's true
Who lives behind a mask was never proved.

F                         Bb         F

Come on Robert Johnson, though we're worlds apart

You and I know what it's like with the devil in our heart

        Cm                         Gm
You sold your soul at the crossroads

           Cm                   Gm
Kept a little of mine on hand

      Eb       G7dim 5th/E   Dm/F   F#m dim 5th
I'm wadin' out this            muddy water

          Gm      Dm/A  Gm/Bb Gm/A Gm
Been stranded in the wa---------steland

Rattlin' chains all around my bed
Ghosts can laugh but they're already dead
I'm not dyin' and I'm far from gone
The bluesman spent his candle, but his pain lives on


Outro: Ad lib Gm
