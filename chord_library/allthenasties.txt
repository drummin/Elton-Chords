if it came to pass that they should ask
             C
what could i tell them?
C/G                    Am9                Bbmaj7
would they criticize behind my back
               C                          F
maybe i should let them
        C             Am7     D9                     Dm7/G  Gsus4
oh if only then and only then they would understand
             C     C/E    F               C/G   G7/B        C    C7/E F C/G  G7/B  C
theyd turn a full blooded city boy into a full blooded city man


C/G                   Am9
if they could face it i could take it
Bbmaj7          C       F/C  C            F/C
in their eyes i know id make it
C/G           Am9                         Bbmaj7
tiny minds of sacred cows just fake it
        C             Am7     D9                     Dm7/G  Gsus4
oh if only then and only then they would understand
             C     C/E    F               C/G   G7/B        C    C7/E F C/G  G7/B  C
theyd turn a full blooded city boy into a full blooded city man


      Bbm  
but i know the way they want me 
Eb7/Bb Abmaj7
in the way they publicize
Bbm                              Eb7/Bb Abmaj7
if they could turn the focus off to the image in their eyes
C/G            G9sus4    C/G            F
maybe it would help them help them understand
C/G            G9sus4    C/G            F
maybe it would help them help them understand
C/G            G9sus4    C/G            F
maybe it would help them help them understand
       C            F                 C/G          F    C        C7/E F C/G  G7/B  C
that a full blooded city boy is now a full blooded city man
