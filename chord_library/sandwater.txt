intro:
C/G    G    C/G    G    C/G    G    D/F#    G


    G       D/F#  G                 C/G
All alone I didnt like the feeling
    G       D/F#
All alone I sat and cried
    G              Em7               C/G
All alone I had to find some meaning
       G             D/F#          G
in the center of the pain I felt inside


All alone I came into this world
All alone I will some day die
Solid stone is just sand and water baby
Sand and water and a million years gone by


D                     C           G
I will see you in the light of a thousand suns
D                      C            G             D
I will hear you in the sound of the waves
       B7              Em         A7              Am7
I will know you when I come as we all will come
            G/B              D
Through the doors beyond the grave


All alone I heal this heart of sorrow
All alone I raise this child
Flesh and bone, he's just brushing towards tomarrow
And his laughter fills my world and wears your smile
