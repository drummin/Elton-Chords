  Bb    F        Eb         Bb\D               F            Bb\F Eb\F

Well he's cruising in the fast lane, stuck behind the wheel

Dm              F\C   Bb             Bb             C7  Fm7
Jekyll and Hyde going on inside when I'm your automobile

I'm a speedy little boy down deep inside

  Cm                             Bb              F

    Bb      F      Eb   Bb\D          F          Bb\F Eb\F
You say I'm just a specimen, and baby I can crawl

        Cm                                   Bb               F
Well my physique just don't look the way the physiques really should

    Bb    F                Eb     Bb\D F        Bb\F  Eb\F
But then again I've got an engine underneath my hood


                        Dm                 Dm         C     Bb
When I'm cutting up the road, yeah, with a sports car on my tail

Dm             F\C Bb                  Bb               C7   Fm7
Frankenstein's inside my mind, and the wind's inside my sails
