F\A  Bb  (Eb\Bb Bb Bb  F  Bb)*


	        Bb    Eb\Bb Bb
He's so sophisticated

	      F
In a critic's eye

		      Bb   Eb\Bb Bb
He needs a change of habit

	         F
But then so do I

	       Bb   Eb\Bb Bb
He's all Zefferelli

	      F
In cool loose clothes

		 Bb
He needs to be rewired

C		        F\A  Bb  (Eb\Bb Bb Bb  F  Bb)*
He's plugged on overload


	        Bb  Eb\Bb Bb
So crisp and new

		 F
Well it had to be

		   Bb    Eb\Bb Bb
I guess he needs a change

		    F
From the likes of me

			Bb   Bb\Eb Bb
If he should lose some color

		   F
When he leaves the sun

		  Bb
I'm sure a little Braggi

C		    F\A  Bb  (Eb\Bb Bb Bb  F  Bb)*
Wouldn't hurt no one


			  Dm     C\D  Dm
'Cause when the fool's in fashion

		Am
He's attracting everyone

			  Gm7  C\G Dm\G
He'll be the head of your list

		     Am
He'll be your dinner guest

            F\A       Bb
If he's the center of attention

	       Bb7       F
Looks like the fool's in fashion


		      Bb    Eb\Bb Bb
You had your pound of flesh

		     F
You got the driver's seat

		      Bb  Eb\Bb Bb
Well you can keep the car

		 F
But I'd like the meat

		     Bb    Eb\Bb Bb
'Cause there must be plenty

		    F
Down in the cutting room

		 Bb    
It's so tough to suffer

C                     F\A  Bb  (Eb\Bb Bb Bb  F  Bb)*
When you want the moon

(CHORUS)

(INSTRUMENTAL VERSE)

(CHORUS)**

F

Eb  Bb\D                Bb7\D      F
