Am				  G\B C			     G\B
Just like a broken marriage, when two people just don't care

Am				G\B	      C
Like when the cupboard is empty or there's no food in the Frigidaire

G		
I'm a page from the end of the story

F
No closer to my hope and glory

Dm   Em F     C\G	   G		C    F\C  C F\C  C C  F\C  C  F\C  C F\C  C F\C  C C  F\C  C  F\C  G\B
Just a  kick away from the heels of the wind


Am				     G\B C   			 G\B
How come it gets so disturbing, when two ships pass in the storm

Am				       G\B   C
Who knows how high the crow flies, who knows where this refugee was born

G
I'm a page from the end of the story

F
No closer to my hope and glory

Dm   Em F     C\G          G		C   F\C  C F\C  C C  F\C  C  F\C  C F\C  C F\C  C C  F\C  C  F\C
Just a  kick away from the heels of the wind


    F            C\E     Dm        C
And just for the sake of all these reasons

F	   C\E     Dm        C
Rains wash out the fires within

F	   Em      E7\G#    Am
Fires that help to keep you moving

Just a  kick away from the heels of the wind


Am				  G\B        C
You don't deserve that treatment, I can't pretend I was that nice

G\B     			      G\B  C
I'm no E ticket ride to Disneyland, I'm no cushy first class flight

G
I'm a day behind your restless wings

F
You, you rather have the wealth of kings

Dm  Em  F      C\G       G		  C F\C  C F\C  C C  F\C C F\C
Me, I'd rather be on the heels of the wind

(CHORUS)

C    F\C C    F\C  C C F\C  C  F\C
Just a   kick a____way,     yeah

Dm   Em F     C\G          G
Just a  kick away from the heels of the wind.
