i used to know this old scarcrow
          Eb               Bb     F7sus
he was my song, my joy and sorrow
Bb                      Bb7      
cast a lone between the furrows
     Eb                      Bb
of a field no longer sown by anyone
Bb7                                       Eb
i held a dandelion that said the time has come
                  F             Bb
to leave upon the wind not to return
                      Eb
till summer burns the earth once again

cultivate the freshest flower
Eb           Bb
this garden ever grew
                  Bb7         Eb
beneath these branches i once wrote
              Bb              Bb7
such childish words for you
                                                     Eb
but thats ok theres treasure children always seek to find
              F                Bb7
and just like us you must have had
              Eb
a once upon a time
