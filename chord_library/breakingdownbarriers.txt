Bb		C	G
I recall how it used to be

Bb	          C
In my younger days

G			
I built a wall all around my heart

   Eb	    F     G
To keep the pain away

Bb		      C	       G
I built it tall and I built it wide

Bb		    C
I left no room for doubt

G
Your love still found its way inside

    Eb	     F	      G
And couldn't get back out


Ab	     Eb\Ab     Bb
I'm breaking down the barriers

Ab     Eb\Ab     Bb
Making up my mind

Bb		       C	  (G)**
I'm breaking down the barriers of time

Ab	   Eb\Ab     Bb
I'm taking down the barriers

Ab	   Eb\Ab      Bb
And loving what I find

Bb		      C		    G
I'm breaking down the barriers that lie

  F	     C	       G
Between your love and mine

(G\F  G\E  G+3\D  D)*


Bb			  C       G
I guess you know you were not the first

Bb		    C
You may not be the last

G
But you have shown me a better way

    Eb	    F	     G
And now I'm learning fast

Bb		       C       G
You gotta go where the feeling flows

Bb		        C
I take it while it's hot

G
You gotta give if you wanna get

    Eb     F       G
And I want all you got

(CHORUS)

**This too should have the G major chord progression.
***G minor should have the progression as well.
