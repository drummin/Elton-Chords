(Ab/Eb  Db)*  (Ab/Eb  Db)*

Ab/Eb		      Db/Eb     Ab/Eb  Db    
When I think of those East End lights, muggy nights

    Ab/C		  Ebm/Bb	  Db/Ab
The curtains drawn in the little room downstairs

Gb	    Gb9		    Ab
Prima Donna lord you really should have been there

Gb	       Gb9	Ab              Db
Sitting like a princess perched in her electric chair

	 Dbm(7)  			    Bb/D
And it's one more beer and I don't hear you anymore

      Db
We've all gone crazy lately

   Bb/D					Ab/Eb		(Eb)
My friends out there rolling round the basement floor


Db		     Ab/C	  Bbm7	     Ab/C
And someone saved my life tonight sugar bear

Db		    Ab/C	Bbm7
You almost had your hooks in me didn't you dear

    Ab/C       Db           Ab/C
You nearly had me roped and tied

Db           Bb/D
Altar-bound, hypnotized

        Ab/Eb
Sweet freedom whispered in my ear

	 [Bb7/D]
	 Ddim/F
You're a butterfly

    Db
And butterflies are free to fly

Bb/D	  Ab/Eb	     C7  Db      Db  Ab/C  Ab/C  Bbm  Bbm  Db/Ab  Gb   (Gb/Db)
Fly away, high away, bye  bye

(Ab/Eb  Db)*  (Ab/Eb  Db)*

Ab/Eb		      Db/Eb     Ab/Eb  Db    
I never realised the passing hours   of evening showers

  Ab/C                Ebm/Bb           Db/Ab
A slip noose hanging in my darkest dreams

    Gb                Gb9      Ab
I'm strangled by your haunted social scene

Gb	Gb9	  Ab      	Db
Just a pawn out-played by a dominating queen

     Dbm(7)
It's four o'clock in the morning

        Bb/D
Damn it listen to me good

    Db
I'm sleeping with myself tonight

Bb/D				    Ab/Eb   (Eb)
Saved in time, thank God my music's still alive

(CHORUS)

(Ab/Eb  Db)*  (Ab/Eb  Db)*

Bbm					 Ab/C
And I would have walked head on into the deep end of the river

Eb/F
Clinging to your stocks and bonds

            Db/Ab
Paying your H.P. demands forever

Bbm				     Ab
They're coming in the morning with a truck to take me home

Eb/F		       Db/Ab
Someone saved my life tonight, someone saved my life tonight

Eb/F		       Db/Ab
Someone saved my life tonight, someone saved my life tonight

Eb/F
Someone saved my life tonight

   Db/Ab					Bb/D
So save your strength and run the field you play alone

(CHORUS)

(Ab/Eb  Db)*  (Ab/Eb  Db)*

(Ab/Eb                                             Db)*
Someone saved, someone saved, someone saved my life tonight.
(REPEAT, FADE)


*In this riff, the left hand does most of the work.  

This is how the line looks, with the left hand playing octaves:

RH:  Ab  Ab  Ab Ab Ab Ab    Ab Ab Ab
LH:  Eb----  Eb F  G  Ab    G  F  Eb  

RH:  Db  Db  Db Db Db Db    Db Db Db
LH:  Db----  Db Db F  Gb    F  Eb Db

It may be a bit difficult to play for those who aren't used to keys with a lot of flats, 
but this is the most effective way to play this song.


**Left hand should be played with a G and an F, as a ninth, if it is possible to reach.
