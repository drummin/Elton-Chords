(*)
As I awoke this evening with the smell of wood smoke clinging


Like a gentle cobweb hanging upon a painted tepee


Oh I went to see my chieftain with my warlance and my woman


For he told us that the yellow moon would very soon be leaving

Ebm						 Ebm9
This I can't believe I said, I can't believe our warlord's dead

      Ebm9		  Abm\Eb	     Ebm7
Oh he would not leave the chosen ones to the buzzards and the soldiers guns


	 Ebm				   Ebm9
Oh great father of the Iroquois ever since I was young

		      Abm\Eb	       Ebm9
I've read the writing of the smoke and breast fed on the sound of drums

     Ebm			      		     Ebm7
I've learned to hurl the tomahawk and ride a painted pony wild

   Ebm9		    Abm\Eb	     Ebm9
To run the gauntlet of the Sioux, to make a chieftain's daughter mine


    Ebm			
And now you ask that I should watch

    Ebm		        Ebm7   Ebm9
The red man's race be slowly crushed

     Ebm	       Abm\Eb
What kind of words are these to hear

     Ebm9
From Yellow Dog whom white man fears

I take only what is mine Lord,    my pony, my squaw, and my child

G	Bm\F#	Em	   G\D  C Am\D		       Em   D
I can't stay to see you die      along with my tribe's pride

Am7		       D		   G		  C\G
I go to search for the yellow moon and the fathers of our sons

	  Em7     Am7	       G        F6(add9)     Am      G      C(***)
Where the red sun sinks in the hills of gold and the healing waters run


G	  Bm\F#	   Em	       G\D  C        Am\D		 Em  D
Trampling down the prairie rose      leaving hoof tracks in the sand

Those who wish to follow me      I welcome with my hands

I heard from passing renegades Geronimo was dead

Em		   G\D	      C		     G\B
Now there seems no reason why I should carry on

Am7		  G\B		   C		  D
In this land that once was my land I can't find a home

     Em		     G\D	   C		      G\B
It's lonely and it's quiet and the horse soldiers are coming

      Am		G\B	 	  C		       D
And I think it's time I strung my bow and ceased my senseless running

    Em		       G\D          C		       G\B
For soon I'll find the yellow moon along with my loved ones

	  Am 		    G\B               C			 D
Where the buffalos graze in clover fields without the sound of guns


	Em	G\D		C		 G\B
And the red sun sinks at last into the hills of gold

    Am		  G\B		C		    Em  (Em7\D  Cmaj7  Em)****
And peace to this young warrior comes with a bullet ho________________le.
