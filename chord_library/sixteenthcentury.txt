Oh it's great to see our homeland

			       G  Bb G  G  Bb G  
Breathe the Iberian atmosphere

       C
Just because we are Hispanic

        C
Doesn't mean we're oceanic

      D7
Quite frankly we've had water up to here

G  Bb G  G  Bb G  

	   C
We've made waves to last a lifetime

				    G  Bb G  G  Bb G  
We've been saturated, almost drowned

       C
We are Spanish not Caribbean

       C
We are human, not amphibian

      D7
We'll seek our fortunes on Spain's solid ground


           G
There's no future in the new world

     F        C             G
Only fools believe the tales

       G
Of the gold of El Dorado

     F       C	       G
Only suckers set their sails

        C
We have seen the way the tide is turning

C
Cortez is a charlatan

       D7               
We are in the ball, discerning

D7
We're anti-diluvian

There are women who are lining

C			  G  Bb G  G  Bb G  
Every avenue in every port

       C
Now at last we'll get to grips with

C
Things they never equip ships with

        D7
We have sailed into our last resort


	   G
There's no goldmine in the new world

       F	C       G
It's a trick to get recruits

       G
On the boat to El Dorado

      F         C      G
We're returning to our roots

            C
We're going back to land locked ladies

C
Cortez never let them board

       D7
All in all the point we've made is

D7
We don't want to go abroad
