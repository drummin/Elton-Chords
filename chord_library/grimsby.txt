G                 C/G    G    C  - G/B - Am7 -  G - D    Dsus-D
As I lay dreaming in my bed across the   great  di-vide.
Am7                   Em            C                   Em
I thought I heard the trawler boats - returning on the tide.
G                  C/G    G       C - G/B - Am7 - G - D    Dsus-D
And in this vision of my home the shingle  beach did ring.
Am7                    Em            C                     D
     I saw the lights along the pier - that made my senses sing.



CHORUS:   Em         D
Oh oh-oh, Grimsby, a thousand delights -
              Em                     Am          D
     couldn't match the sweet sights of-of-of my Grimsby.
    C                                G                       D
Oh, England you're fair but there's none to compare with my Grimsby.
D#dim  Em                      D                        | C / / / | / / Bm D |
Thru nights of mad youth I've loved every sluice in your harbor.
    Em                       D
And in your wild sands from boyhood to man -
C                              | B  /  B/A / | B/F# / / / | {Intro, end in G}
strangers have found themselves fathers.



G                C/G     G       C - G/B - Am7 - G - D      Dsus-D
Take me back you rustic town, I miss your  ma - gic charm.
Am7                Em              C                     Em
Just to smell your candy floss or drink in the Skinners Arms.
G                   C/G       G     C - G/B - Am7 - G - D      Dsus-D
No Cordon Bleu can match the beauty of  your  pies and peas.
Am7                 Em          C                     D
I want to ride your fairground.   Take air along the quay.
