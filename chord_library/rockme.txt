Intro: G  C G  D  D  C 
G  C  G  G  D  C 

G                               C             G
Warm the wine and give it to me one more time again

G                        D
I'm just a rolling stone who needs a drop of rain

       Em                D9           C              G
And to taste your honey, Mona is like licking on the sun

G                                       C 
My truck's hid in the back yard so come here and give me some


G
Said lady, that's the way

             C                   G
You've gotta rock me when he's gone

                                           D7 
You make me feel like a diesel train going home

          G 
We got so much to give each other

          C             G
And we've only just begun

   G             Em 
So take me baby, break me lady

      C       C          C  D9 D9 D9 D9 D9 D9 
Gotta rock me when he's gone


G                         C                    G
Break the bread in two and you can give me half

G                         D
I've ridden hard and fast just to make you laugh

   Em                 D9                  C                    G
To make you laugh I've stood knee-deep in mud outside your door

G                             C 
Clutching in my hand a border rose from Baltimore
