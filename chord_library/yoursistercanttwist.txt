I could really get off being in your shoes

 	  E
I used to be stone sold on rhythm and blues

  A
A heard of a place at the back of town

	  E
Where you really kick the shit when the sun goes down


  E
I really got buzzed when your sister said

E
"Throw away them records `cause the blues is dead

A					    E
Let me take you honey where the scene's on fire"

       B				   A        E
And tonight I learned for certain that the blues expired


	B7
Oh your sister can't twist but she can rock and roll

E
Out bucks the broncos in the rodeo-do

      B7
She's only sixteen but it's plain to see

E
She can pull the wool over little old me

     A
Your sister can't twist but she can rock and roll

     B						    E  B7  
Your sister can't twist but she got more soul than me

E
Somebody help me `cause the bug bit me

    E
Now I'm in heaven with the aching feet

 	    A
But I'll be back tonight where the music plays

	 E
And your sister rocks all my blues away


  E
I really got buzzed when your sister said

E
"Throw away them records `cause the blues is dead

A					    E
Let me take you honey where the scene's on fire"

       B				   A        E
And tonight I learned for certain that the blues expired
