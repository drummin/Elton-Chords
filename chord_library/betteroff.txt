Intro: G/B - C - G - Am - E - F - G/B - C

C                                      F               C
There was a face on a hoarding that someone had drawn on
                                                         F    Am/E
And just enough time for the night to pass by without warning
D                                             C     G
Away in the distance there's a blue flashing light
Am                    F         C
Someone's in trouble somewhere tonight
       F/C         C             G       F 
As the flickering neon stands ready to fuse
       F/C         C             G       Am 
The wind blows away all of yesterday's news

C                                       F                      C
Well they've locked up their daughters and they battened the hatches
                                                      F    Am/E
They always could find us but they never could catch us
D                                             C          G
Through the grease streaked windows of an all night cafe
Am                           F    C
We watched the arrested get taken away
          F/C       C        G       F 
And that cigarette haze has ecology heat
       F/C             C            G           Am          
As the whores and the drunks filed in from the street

E                                                  Am  Am7/E
`Cause the steams in the boiler, the coals in the fire
        F                           G   C
If you ask how I am then I'll just say inspired
E                                            Am  Am7/E
If the thorn of a rose is the thorn in your side
F                                   G           Am
Then you're better off dead if you haven't yet died

Outro: G/B - C - G - Am - E - F - G/B - C
