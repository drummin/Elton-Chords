Hey there Georgie, got a couple of things to say.
G                          C               G              D
One you're my friend, and two it's hurting me seeing you act this way.
C/D - G/D         D                          D7              G      C/G  G
          But my hands are tied & I can only try to talk you out of  a  fall.
           F#m               Bm         
`Cause the reputation of the woman you're dating's
                                  G/A    A    G/A   A
     'bout as nasty as the Berlin wall.


CHORUS:
C          F             G         C                 F         G
Slow down Georgie she's poison.   Man you've got to watch yourself.
             C           F                 G            Am
She's gonna get in your head, she's gonna crawl in your bed.
               Dm                         G
You're just a stepping stone for someone else.
C          F             G               C           F     G
Slow down Georgie she's poison.   She's just another divorcee.
   C          F           G      Am    Dm          G       C       F     G
An undercover lover of a hundred other little fish in the sea.  Oh-oh-oh-oh.


            D                                      G   D
You better cut her loose before she gets her hooks in you.
D7      G                             C           G
If you gave her the world, and it was covered in pearls - 
                 D
     she'd only ask for the moon.
C/D - G/D                 D                              D7
            She's got you hypnotized, with her big brown eyes -
           G                    C/G  G
     and a body that could stop  a  clock.
            F#m                        Bm
But if you think your face ain't gonna be replaced -
                                  G/A   A     G/A   A
     Georgie boy you're in for a shock.


Well it ain't my job to rain on your parade.
But if the chips were down, you'd do the same for me - s'always been that way
She's got you paralyzed with a pack of lies about honor and the single girl.
And if you buy that line you must be out of your mind.
     You must be living in another world.
