Intro: C    Am add 7   F   C/G  G    


           C    F/C      C                    F      Bb/F   F
We all lead             such elaborate lives

             G    C/G   G7          C     C sus   C
Wild ambitions           in our sights

               C   C/D    E7                         Am
How an affair                   of the heart survives

          Dm/F     FM7    G7
Days apart and hurried nights


G          G        E7
Seems quite unbelievable to me

                       Am
I don't want to live like that

 Am     Am      E7  
Seems quite unbelievable to me

                       Am
I don't want to love like that

G                               A        A7             D7      G7     
G     F/C   C
I just want our time to be     slower and gentler, wi-----ser,  free

We all live in extravagant times
Playing games we can't all win
Unintended emotional crimes
Take some out, take others in

I'm so tired of all we're going through
I don't want to live like that
I'm so tired of all we're going through
I don't want to love like that
I just want to be with you now and forever, peaceful, true


C                      F        Bb/F   F
I wish I had the courage

                             C    F/C   C
To tell you face to face

                              D7
But I could wait forever

                                      G      F/G
For the perfect time and place


F/G       C         (rest of verse same as 1st)
We all   live such elaborate lives
We don't know whose words are true
Strangers, lovers, husbands, wives
Hard to know whose loving who

Too many choices tear us apart
I don't want to live like that
Too many choices tear us apart
I don't want to love like that
I just want to touch your heart, may this confession be the start
