             There's a porch swing in Tupelo, in the shape of the south,
                             Bb                                         F/A               Eb      Bb
             Where the sweet honey drips out by that old hush your mouth.
                      F     Em         Dm  C     Bb              F
             It's a slow road on down that old Natchez Trace,
                          A            A/Db   Dm         Eb        F      C   A/Db
             Through Alabama cotton fields to a state of grace.


Verse 2:         Dm        Em   F                   C            Dm
             It's a crisp, golden autumn on the Tennessee line,
                       Bb                   F/A                              Eb          Bb
             Rollin' down the Mississippi like you're headed back in time.
             F          Em          Dm      C         Bb  Bb/Eb  F
             Town's closed on Sunday.  Everybody's in church.
                                       A    A/C#  Dm   Eb        F      Bb/F   F
             It's empty as the moon, this place here on earth.

            And, this place don't change.          Some places move slow.
                                        G        Am   Bb              Bb/B  C   Bb/C   C
            I'm just rockin' myself on this porch swing in Tupelo.
                   Db           Dm        C               Bb
            I got nothin' to do 'cept hang in the breeze.
                                 F                 Em           Dm
            Ghosts of the old south are all around me.
            C                 Bb                        F
            Yeah, swing high.  Yeah, swing low.
                              Bb/G           Bb/Eb  F
            Here on this porch swing in Tupelo.

             His mama must have loved him, that truck drivin' boy.
                          Bb                                     F/A              Eb     Bb   Eb   Bb
             With the grease monkey look, and a rock and roll voice.
                               F    Em        Dm        C           Bb               F
             Well, I was just thinkin' about him 'cause I guess he sat here.
                           A   A/Db     Dm                Eb           F
             Singin', "ah, praise to god," through poverty's tears,
