     Em                      Cmaj7/E
The grass in Ashfield Park is dying
      B          B7                 Em  G/D
Where everybody dreams of deeds of crime...
         A
And the Tartan Coloured Lady walks
  F#7                           Bm  Am  G
Behind the water colours of my mind......
         D                           A  G  Em  B7
And the Tartan Coloured Lady she is mine.........

 Em                            Cmaj7/E
People speak of willow trees in autumn
    B                B7         Em  G/D
And my cloak doesn't fit her anymore...
         A
And the Tartan Coloured Lady that I wanted
F#7                                     Bm  Am  G
Walked out this place, an hour or so before......
         D                              A
And the Tartan Coloured Lady locks her door

   D                            E
So if your crystal window is unbroken
             G                                 D
And they've taken all the dust bins from your door
 C                                 D
Take yourself the Tartan Coloured Lady
      G                                    D
And smell the grass in Ashfield Park once more
F#7                                  Bm  Am  G  Em  B7
See the trees in Ashfield Park once more..............

      Em                                  Cmaj7/E
So I guess I'll read the comic books you've left me
B        B7              Em  G/D
And play marbles on the floor...
    A
And if the Tartan Coloured Lady calls me
F#7                                 Bm  Am  G
Just tell her I won't be home till four......
    D                                A
Or just tell her I won't be home no more

   D                            E
So if your crystal window is unbroken
             G                                 D
And they've taken all the dust bins from your door
 C                                 D
Take yourself the Tartan Coloured Lady
      G                                    D
And smell the grass in Ashfield Park once more
F#7                                  Bm  Am  G
See the trees in Ashfield Park once more......
D     A       G    Em    B7
Mmmmmmmmmmmmm Oooooooooooooh
