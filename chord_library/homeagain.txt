(Verses 1,2)

    Dm              Gm            Dm
I'm counting on a memory to get me out of here
     Dm              Gm                           Dm
I'm waiting for the fog around this spooky little town to clear
             C          C            A    Dm
All this time I spent being someone else's friend 
               Eb                                   Bb      Am    Dm
Just one more time, for old time's sake I'd like to go back home again

Dm                   Gm            Dm
 The world had seven wonders once upon a time
Dm                            Gm             Dm
 It's sure enough the favored nations aided their decline
           C                C                A     Dm
And all around me I've seen times like it was back when
               Eb                                     A
But like back then, I'd say a men if I could get back home again

(Chorus:) 
           Bb       F
If I could go back home, 
           Bb       F
if I could go back home
       Dm              Dm          C
If I'd never left, I'd never have known
        Bb        Am
We all dream of leaving, 
    Bb      F      G          A
but wind up in the end
         Dm                      Bb      Am    Dm
Spending all our time trying to get back home again

(Verse 3 > play as Verse 2)
Could have been a jailbreak and a spotlight hitting me
Or was I just some nightclub singer, back in 1963
In the old part of Valencia, on the coast of Spain
Never tiring once of hearing songs about going home again

[Chorus x2:]
If I could go back home, if I could go back home
If I'd never left, I'd never have known
We all dream of leaving, but wind up in the end
Spending all our time trying to get back home again
