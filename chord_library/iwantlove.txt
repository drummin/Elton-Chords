Intro:

A	F#m	C#m	C	D
A	F#m	C#m	C	D


Verse:


A      F#m              E
I want love but it's impossible

C#m        F#m         D  
A man like me so irresponsible

C#Maj            F#m      F#m/E  
A man like me is dead in places

B               D7/E E
Other men feel liberated.


Verse 2:


(Chords same as 1st verse)
And I can't love shot full of holes
Don't feel nothing, I just feel cold.
Don't feel nothing, just old scars
Toughening up around my heart.


Chorus:

A               G/A
But I want love, just a different kind.

D                   Dm/F
I want a love won't break me down,

      A                  F#Maj 
Won't brick me up, won't fence me in.

         B
I want a love that don't mean a thing.

            E7          C#/E  E7   Am/C  D
That's the love I want. I    want love.



Verse 3:

(Chords same as 1st verse.)
I want love on my own terms,
After everyting I've ever learned.
Me, I carry too much baggage.
Oh man, I've seen so much traffic.


Bridge:

F               C
So bring it on, I've been bruised.

G                         C
Don't give me love that's clean and smooth.

Cm                Bb
I'm ready for the rougher stuff.

F                 D         D/E  E/G#
No sweet romance, I've had enough.



Instrumental break:


A  F#m  E  C#m  F#m  D


C#Maj            F#m      F#m/E  
A man like me is dead in places

B               D7/E E
Other men feel liberated.
