I've a constant ache in the morning light

          Am7\F	       G        C   F\C C
It's on account of the night before

     Am
Some Park Lane lady in a shady bar

       Am7\F	    G	     C   F\C C
Took a fancy to the watch I wore


    Am
But I can still remember how she laughed at me

     Am7\F	     G	     C   F\C C
As I spun around and hit the bed

	 Am
She said thank you honey, forget about the money

     Am7\F 	     G    Am
This pretty watch'll do instead


E			     F
City living woman, you're so static

E				      F      Cm\G
Downtown hustlers trying to pull some muscle
