(Bb\D  Bb\F F)*  Bb\D**  F  C\E  Dm  F\C  Bb\D**  Bb\F F

     F                C\E                   Bb\D            F
They laid beneath the pine trees with their caps over their eyes

          Bb                  F            Bb               C
They were drunk with home and mama as they brushed away the flies

      Bb                 F                Bb                F
In an instant before the sunrise they had gunned the rebels down

         Bb                 F                C            F
As their flags were torn at half mast in the ruins of the town


           F                  C\E           Bb\D            F
There were white sails on the water for the crippled on the beach

            Bb          F             Bb        C
There was a lack of ammunition so the cause was incomplete

         Bb            F                  Bb                    F
When the bugle blew at breakfast and they knew their ships were in

         Bb      F            C                  F
Signs of grand assurance were carried on the wind


        F    C\E         Dm   F\C          Bb
Take it home,    take it low, take responsibilities

Gm  			       C  Bb
Came the message from the front

        F        C\E          Dm      F\C Bb     C\A  
For the captains,    captains quarters    must retreat

         Gm7               C               Bb   F
Pack the compass, pack the tents, take the bunks


          F      C\E         Dm     F\C       Bb         F
They just chalked it down in history but they kept their uniforms

               Bb            F			 Bb 		    C
They put their medals on the sideboards and they went back to their farms

	   Bb             F		  Gm 		   F
For it was just a mere reminder that they stood beside the best

     Bb		       F		  C		     F
That God had saved the chosen few and the devil took the rest

(CHORUS)

       F                C\E                 Bb\D              F
On the planes above the rock face where the sculptured eagles swoop

          Bb 				    Gm		    C
There's a haunted yell for action among the spectres of his troops

       Bb	     F		      Bb	   F
It was silent on the coastline as the crazy angels danced

 	 Bb                   F		       C            F
With the sound of retreating footfall from his military camp

(CHORUS)

Bb\D**  F
	Take it home,    

Bb\D**  F
	Take it low, 

Bb\D**  F
	Take responsibilities

Bb\D**  F  C\E  Dm  F\C  Bb_____________


*Use single notes in the right and left hand as follows:

RH:  F(chord) Bb(chord)  F(chord) Bb(chord)  C D Eb D C Bb D
LH:  C        D          C        D                        

**Similar to the first pattern, only use chords as follows:

RH:  F Bb  F Bb  F Bb Eb Bb F Bb
LH:  C D   C D   C D  Eb D  C Bb

In the outtro, I'd suggest using a brass arrangement on synthesizer to play these chords.
