              G                                  C                   G
Well he could almost taste the money but he was sitting in a den of 
thieves.
D                G      C                           G      D
Looking for the great awakening - trying to find a way to leave.
     G             Am    G/B              C
But that's when he got religion, and the light went on inside.
        G/D      C/E      G/F                  C              C/D   G 
(intro)
He said somebody up there likes me.  Now he's working for the holy 
guide.



        G                                          C                     
G
He got drunk but he don't remember that he'd been drinking in a bar 
downtown.
         D                  G       C                     G     D
When he thought he heard a choir of angels singing in the Tiki Lounge.
     G             Am    G/B              C
And that's when he got religion - from no salesman on TV.
       G/D        C/E             G/F
Just a tap on the shoulder in the parking lot.
          C            C/D     G
He still drinks but he does believe.



CHORUS:
   C          G      F         E
Religion, you do the best you can.
C                G                          D                G
We all make the same mistakes, we're gonna wind up with the man.
   C             G      F         E
Religion, oh you do the best you can.
C                G                          D               G  (play 
intro)
We all make the same mistakes, we're gonna wind up with the man.



         G                             C                         G
She was silent as he paid her but the thanks she got was next to none.
            D          G         C                            G       D
And as her car pulled out of the motel, she felt the presence of 
someone.
     G              Am    G/B              C
And that's when she got religion - in the front of a compact Ford.
       G/D    C/E           G/F                  C                C/D       
G
Just a gentle voice on the stereo.  Now she's a working girl who loves 
the Lord.
