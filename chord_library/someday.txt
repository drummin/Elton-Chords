intro:Bb  F  Eb


Bb       F          Gm
Some day out of the blue
Bb   Eb  F   Bb          F        Eb
In a crowded street or a deserted square
           Bb/D    Eb   F
I'll turn and I'll see you
   Dm               Eb
As if our love were new
Gm       F/A    Bb           F        Bb     Eb/Bb  Bb
Some day we can start again, some day soon


Eb             Bb
Here comes the night
Cm            Gm
Here come the memories
Eb           Bb/D
Lost in your arms
Cm          Gm
Down in the foreign fields
Cm     Bb   Eb  
Not so long ago
F
Seems like eternity
Cm          Bb Eb  F       D/F#
Those sweet af ter noons
              Gm   F       Eb
Still capture me


TO CHORUS:


I still believe
I still put faith in us
We had it all and watched it slip away
Where are we now
Not where we want to be
Those hot afternoons
Still follow me

Some day out of the blue
Maybe years from now
Or tomorrow night
I'll turn and I'll see you
As if we always knew
Some day we would live again, some day soon

Eb        Bb
I still believe
            Cm       
I still put faith in us (play 3 times) Bb  F/A  Gm7  F  Ebadd9
