       G				C\G	   G
Yeah I looked at my watch and it said a quarter to five

	      C			  Cm    C
The headlines screamed that I was still alive

  Cm  C
I couldn't understand it

  F			   G F\A Gdim\Bb G\B  F\C  C
I thought I died last night


     G			   C\G	  G
Oh I dreamed I'd been in a border town

	       C	     Cm   C
In a little cantina that the boys had found

      Cm C
I was desperate to dance

F			    G C\G  G C\G  G C\G F\G  F\G C\G
Just to dig the local sounds


Dm7		  G
When along came a señorita

Dm7			  G\F
She looked so good that I had to meet her

      C\G		    D\A		      G\B
I was ready to approach her with my English charm

	 C     Bb       F\A Gm	   F C\E Dm C            G F\A Gdim\Bb G\B  F\C  C
When her brass knuckled boy-friend grabbed  me by the arm

                    G F\A Gdim\Bb G\B  F\C  C
(Oh he was so macho!)


	    A7   D\A  A		   A   A A\C# A\E
And he said grow some funk of your own a-mi__-go

A7   D\A  A	       A
Grow some funk of your own

D
We no like to with the gringo fight

	  E
But there might be a death in Mexico tonight

	     A7   D\A  A     	    A   A A\C# A\E
If you can't grow some funk of your own a-mi__-go

A7   D\A  A	       A
Grow some funk of your own

F#		
Take my advice, take the next flight

    E		    E7sus     E9      D
And grow your funk, grow your funk at home

(I mean the situation was ridiculous,  Oh!)

G F\A Gdim\Bb G\B  F\C  C


       G			   C\G        G    
Well I looked for support from the rest of my friends

		    C		       Cm     C
For their vanishing trick they get ten out of ten

  C    
I knelt to pray

	F               C\F   G\F  G F\A Gdim\Bb G\B  F\C  C
Just to see if he would comprehend


     G			   C\G	  G
Oh I dreamed I'd been in a border town

	       C	     Cm   C

       G       F\A Gdim\Bb G\B  F\C  C
(Oh it hurt so much!)

I'll grow some funk,                 Yeah, I'll grow some funk of my own.
