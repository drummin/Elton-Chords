Made for Me
Music by Elton John
Lyrics by Bernie Taupin
UK B-Side (1990)

[Intro (where each || represents one bar of 4/4 time sig)]:

||: Gm | C Gm/Bb C Gm/Bb :|| (repeat 4x)

Gm			     Gm/F			Eb
If I wasn't born to love you, why was I born at all
			      Cm	      Dsus4		Gm
If I wasn't meant to hold you, what are these two arms for
			Gm/F				Eb
If I can't protect you, what are these muscles for
			    Cm			D7sus	Ab
If I can't enrich your life, I might as well be poor
			    Gm				Cm
If I couldn't see you naked, I might as well be blind
			      Ab	    Cm/A   D
If I couldn't treat you right, wouldn't I be so unkind

[Chorus]:
    G
And you were made for me
Eb/Bb
You were made for me
Cm
You weren't born to be alone
    G
And you were made for me
G
You were made for me
Eb/Bb
You were made for me
Bb                   Cm	
Flesh and bone, it's etched in stone
        Dsus		    Gm
That you were made for me
			 ^^^ Last time to Coda after this bar

| Gm | Gm | Gm | Gm |

If I couldn't translate fantasy, imagine how I'd feel
If I couldn't hear your secret, my ears would both be sealed
And if I can't make love to you, this body has no use
If you believe I loved you, you wouldn't need no proof
And if I can't return to you, I wouldn't need my legs to run
And if I can't draw warmth from you, why do I need this sun

[Chorus]

[Instrumental Solo]:
||: Gm | Gm | Gm/F | Gm/F | Eb | Eb | Cm | Dsus D :|| (repeat once)

[Chorus] (to Coda at the end when prompted)

[Coda]:
||: G | G |
Made for me
| Eb/Bb | Eb/Bb |
Made for me
| Cm | Cm |
You weren't born to be alone
| G | G :||
And you were made for me	(Repeat and Fade Coda)
