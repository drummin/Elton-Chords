       C
It's a hot summer night in the blackboard jungle.
Crime sits heavy on the city shoulder.
F                                      C
Can't get no work, I can't get a job.
       Ab                  Bb                C
I just sit and play my radio in the parking lot.


             C
Well they're breaking down doors in foreign countries.
Everybody thinks somebody's hiding something.
         F                                    C
There's talk on the street and the nation is worried.
         Ab                          Bb                         C
But you can't talk back when you're dead, when you're dead and buried.


CHORUS:              F (Bass: /F-/F-/Eb-/D-/C, twice)
Oh, and everybody's restless.                 
             C    (Bass: /C-/C-/Bb-/A-/G, twice)
Everybody's scared.
             Am                        C/E   F     G
Everybody's looking for something that just ain't there.   
C    Bb      F   C
Everybody's restless.


C
Everybody's scared, they think we're all in danger.
Everyone's taking cover from someone else's anger.
     F                              C
The walls have ears, Big Brother's watching.
             Ab                           Bb                     C
They tell us  -  that we're poisoned from everything that we're touching.

(CHORUS)


C/Bb   C
Well,  we could be children from the way we're acting.
We feed ourselves lies and then we scream for action.
F                                       C
We just breed - yeah - and we lose our nerve.
             Ab                       Bb            C
And there's bombs going off in every corner of the world.

OUTRO:   Rest - less.    Everybody's   rest - less.
