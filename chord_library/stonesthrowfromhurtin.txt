INTRO:  Bb  Bb7/F   Bb   Bb7/F   Eb   Db   Bb {twice}

Bb                                      Eb
Help me information, get emotion on the line.
     F                                              F7      Bb
This war that's raging in my heart's getting harder all the time.
                                                            Eb
Our painted smiles are cracking.   Our worried friends just frown.
          F                                               F7     Bb
We got a runaway train on an empty track that's trying to run us down.



CHORUS:
          Eb                  Bb     F             F7    Bb
And I'm a stone's throw from hurtin' everything we put together.
Cm           Gm             Ab                     Eb
Knee deep in learning about burning this bridge forever.
                        Bb            Cm                        Gm
I'm a stone's throw, a stone's throw   -   a stone's throw from hurtin'.
      Bb - Eb         Bb/F        F/A    Bb
And I know   -   it's never gonna get no better.


Bb                                      Eb
Crippled conversation hangs inside this house.
    F                                       F7         Bb
Our voices just get ugly when our love gets all talked out.
                                                        Eb
Your goodnight kiss ain't hungry - our touches don't connect.
             F                                              F7      Bb
We're just a couple of kids with a broken toy that our idle fingers wrecked.


{Repeat Chorus}


Bb   F/A   G               Cm     F                 Bb       F/A  
           Some things get broken - when stones get thrown.
G               Cm                C          
Some things get better - when you leave what you love,
             C7/E               F     Gm7    F/A   F7/A
     and you let what you love alone.


{Repeat Chorus, then Intro}
