G             C        G          C       G         D   D(addE) - D
Tonight it's hot down here, I can almost smell the rain.
G                 C         G     Bm/D       D
And I can almost taste the fear behind your name.
G                   C   G           C           G      D   D(addE) - D
Fans turning on the ceiling, I feel sticky as a chili dog.
G                         C   G   Bm/D            D
White boys howling in the evening on that hollow log.


Em                  C                             D    Dsus - D
Tall tales down the river say we aim to bury the truth.
    Em                 C          G/D         D
The right hand just delivered the devil in a suit.

And he talks big in Whitewash County.

Talks sweet as su - gar cane.
      Em    D     C      G/B   F                C/E    Cm/Eb
Got a past that's filled with lightning.  Got a future filled with rain.



G                 C      G            C               G    D  DaddE - D
Bug buzzing in an empty glass, fiddle scratching some lazy tune.
G                          C        G           Bm/D       D
We're just some place that history passed - new dust, new broom.
G                    C        G               C     G       D   DaddE - D
And it's a high hot buttered moon, he's got a shiny new wax face.
G                        C           G       Bm/D      D
Swears the South's gonna rise again soon all over the place.

Rain down on Whitewash County.

Smell the air coming up the line.
             Em      D    C   G/B   F            C/E   Cm/Eb        G  {intro}
Well you've changed your face so   often but you never change your mind.
