INTRO: A / / /   G/A / D/A /   A / / /   G/D / D /
       A / / /   G/A / D/A /   A / / /   G   / D /


              D                            A
She looked so easy - 'cause she looked so young. 
       /C#   /E  F#m    E               A
With a gei - sha smile   -   made in Taiwan.
        /C#     D                A
She got cherry bombs inside her eyes -
             /C#  /E     F#m     E           A
     and the luck of the Irish   -   on her side.


               D                            A
Don't let her tell you that she loves your mind.
      /C#  /E   F#m   E                     A
She's got  her price,    she can turn on a dime.
      /C#        D                    A
Those crocodile tears ain't tears of pain.
/C#    /E      F#m     E               A
Look a little closer,     that's acid rain.


CHORUS:      D                                    A
And I don't know - why li'l frigerator you're so cold.
         /C#        D     G/D - D                    F#m
Go li'l 'frigerator go.             Get away from my soul.
          E           D         A / / /   G/A / D/A /   A / / /   G / D /      
Oh, li'l 'frigerator you're so cold.



           D                       A
She's calculated with the kiss of death.
      /C#   /E  F#m   E                 A
Got a di-gi-tal mind     and expensive breath.
         /C#    D                        A
She's an empty shell, you're a piece of meat.
/C#   /E        /F#m     E                   A
Just another statistic   -   on her readout sheet.
