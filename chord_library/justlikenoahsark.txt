. . .    Ab  Db   Bb
 
     Bb
It's just like Noah's ark

There's two of every kind
       Eb7
Pretty girls and boys in drag

Walking a fine thin line
         Db
Shaking hands and bussing cheeks
              Gb
Licking their lips like they could eat
    Bb
Me alive in a couple of weeks
Ab     Eb7             Bb
Yeah, just like Noah's ark
Bb
Italian promotion men

Chomping a big cigar
         Eb7
Slapping backs and making cracks

About the fags in the bar
      Db                          Gb
Radio boss dipping his nose in a little white packet
        Bb
You can put it out son and we'll all back it
Ab     Eb7             Bb
Yeah just like Noah's ark


chorus:
         Ab                  Bb 
And the waves are crashing around us
          Eb7   Ab        Bb
But we're ready for the flood
         Ab                     Bb 
And we don't need a sign like an olive branch
         Eb7     Ab        Bb
In the beak of a snow white dove
             C                G
We're not as dumb as we might look
          D              G
You can't keep us in the dark
     Cm     Bb       Ab
With me and you it's two by two
Gb        Ab     Bb
Just like Noah's ark
