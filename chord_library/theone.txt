D\C  C  D\C  C  (D\C  C  D\C  C)*

D\C	           	  C
I saw you dancing out the ocean

D\C		       G\B
Running fast along the sand

Gm\B			   Eb
A spirit born of earth and water

Eb		      F    Eb\F
Fire flying from your hands

Bb			Eb7
In the instant that you love someone

F\A			Bb
In the second that the hammer hits

Fm	     G\B          F\A G\B
Reality runs up your spine

Cm			F  Eb\F
And the pieces finally fit


Bb		      D\F#  
And all I ever needed was the one

Gm			       Bb
Like freedom fields where wild horses run

F#			Bb
When stars collide like you and I

   Ab\Bb Bb   Ab\Bb Bb  Eb  Bb\D
No sha-  dows block the sun

Cm			
You're all I've ever needed

F		    Bb
Baby you're the one


D\C		      C
There are caravans we follow

D\C			 G\B
Drunken nights in dark hotels

Gm\Bb				 Eb
When chances breathe between the silence

Eb			        F  Eb\F
Where sex and love no longer gel


Bb		    Eb7
For each man in his time is Cain

F\A		Bb
Until he walks along the beach

Fm			   G    F\A  G\B
And sees his future in the water

            Cm		          F  Eb\F
A long lost heart within his reach
