Verse 1:Gm  F   Bb                        Gm                    Cm
             Me and you, we're not that pretty.   Me and you could use a lift.
                         F              Bb/D    Gm              Eb               Bb       F
             I'm out here on the corner crying.  I got rythms, but I got no gift.
                         Bb                           Gm               Cm
             Me and you, we're all we've got.  Me and you could be a curse.
                              F           Bb/D        Gm                           Eb
             We've got bleeding hearts and flowers.  You've got strings, but 
                        Bb       F
             You've got no purse.


Chorus:                 Eb                   F                   Bb                     Ab9
            We're just freaks in love.  Saints above, shine on our sweet life.
             Eb                F          Bb          F/A      Gm  F    Eb
             Happy is the union of fools and freaks alike, and fearless
                         F       Bb           Adim          Gm                Eb       G/D
             Are the idiots among the hawks and doves.  We're on the outside
             Cm                 F             Eb         Bb   Bb/G   Eb   F   Gm   Adim
             Looking in;  A couple of freaks in love.


Verse 2: Gm     F  Bb                 Gm                       Cm  
             There's a wonder in this weakness.  It's so beautiful sometimes.  
                              F   Bb/D             Gm             Eb               Bb       F
             Across the universe, with lightning; in the race, we're a step behind.
                         Bb                        Gm                        Cm            
             Me and you, we're not for everyone.  Me and you, we're damaged
                                        F            Bb/D   Gm           Eb       Bb      F
             Goods.  We're antique and unacceptable, and just misunderstood.


(Repeat Chorus)

             We're on the outside looking in; A couple of freaks in love.
