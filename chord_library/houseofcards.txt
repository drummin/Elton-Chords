Intro: G  Em  G  Em

F                           C 
I hear tell some playboy has kidnapped your heart

G                                 C            Bb
With his plane and his plans for games after dark

       Am                          D\F#
Just a pain in his pocket, and the price of a room

          C           G\B            Am7           Em
Where the second hand sheets smell of stale perfume



          F                           C 
If there's sharks in the water, don't swim where it's deep

        G                       C     Bb
For the taste of success can be bitter and sweet

   Am                      D\F#
It could be alright that I act like a child

    C              G\B            Am7        Em
But you'll be the loser when the jokers run wild


            G                         Em
You're just playing the game, but the stakes are too high

D              C          Em    Dm       Dm  Dm Db
What will you do when the chips start to fly

         Em               D5\D               C           Db
When the deck's stacked against you, and the living gets hard

        D              Em            Eb        G
Oh it's four walls of madness in this house of cards


Em  G  Em


F                       C 
Common you call me, but I know there's time

     G                      C                Bb
In a handful of diamonds, a heart's hard to find

    Am                         D\F#
And your house of cards starts weighing you down

     C             G\B               Am7                 Em
Your nights become restless when the clubs start to pound

(CHORUS 2x)
