A Little Peace
(B-Side "All That I'm Allowed")

Intro: Dm  G  Dm  G

       Dm    
It's a tired old world that we're living in

          G
Where the voice of reason is wearing thin

      Bb                  Fm/Ab 
Got a beaten earth, got a hole in the sky

      G                         C
Got a whole lot of angry people crying


                      F  
"I want an eye for an eye"


   Dm 
Compassion sunk without a trace

     G
All trust is gone, have we lost our faith

      Bb                   Fm/Ab
Got a taste for hate, got a lot of guns

      G                          C     
Got a whole lot of family values bitching

                      F 
"Just blame it on the young"


Chorus:

             A
And a little peace goes a long, long way

              Dm
It's peace we want, for peace we pray

         A
A little peace goes a long, long way

              Dm
It's peace we want, for peace we pray

         Bb                 Fm/Ab 
Ain't so crazy, John Lennon knew

         G                 C                       Bb/F    F   Bb/F  F
That a little peace goes a long, long way when you want it to


We crush the ones who don't agree
Whose lifestyles clash with you and me
Got our TV sets full of talking heads
Got a whole lot of people walking around
Like the night of the living dead


Chorus:


Eb                     Bb/D  
Our summer of love has come and gone

   F 
Us sixties kids are getting on

   Eb           Bb/D
We had a dream way back then

   Gm                        C
No reason why we can't dream again


Solo: Dm  G  Bb  Fm/Ab  G  C  F

         A
A little peace goes a long, long way

        Dm 
Hmm hmm hmm Yeah yeah yeah

         A
A little peace goes a long, long way

              Dm
It's peace we want, for peace we pray

A little peace goes a long, long way

It's peace we want, for peace we pray
