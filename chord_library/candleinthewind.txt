Intro: | B | B7 - E - B7 | E | B |

E                                  A
Goodbye Norma Jean, though I never - knew you at all -
             B7       E                   A      E         A
You had the grace to hold yourself while those around you crawled.
                         E                            A
They crawled out of the woodwork.  And they whispered - into your brain.
                     E                  Esus      E           A
They set you on the treadmill, and they made you change your name.



CHORUS: B                                      E             A
And it seems to me you lived your life like a candle in the wind.
       E             Esus  E#           B
Never knowing who to cling to when the rain set in.
       A                                           C#m
And I would have liked to have known you but I was just a kid.
                        B                A           A   A G#m F#m E  {Intro}
Your candle burned out long before your legend ever did.



E                                       A
Loneliness was tough, the toughest role - you ever played.
             B7      E               A            E         A
Hollywood created a superstar - and pain was the price you paid.
               E            A
Even when you died, oh the press still hounded you.
                E                  Esus    E           A
All the papers had to say was that Marilyn - was found in the nude.


{Repeat Chorus}

E                                  A
Goodbye Norma Jean, though I never - knew you at all -
             B7       E                   A     E          A
You had the grace to hold yourself while those around you crawled.
E                                             A
Goodbye Norma Jean, from the young man in the 22nd row.
                              B7       E
Who sees you as something as more than sexual - 
                A            E     A      G#m7  F#m7
     more than just our Marilyn Monroe.
 

{Repeat Chorus}

                        B                A           A   A G#m F#m E  {Intro}
Your candle burned out long before your legend ever did.
