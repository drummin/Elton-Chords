D	Am
Deep inside
   C		 G
My soul fights a war
	F
I can't explain
	      C		G
I can't cross over anymore
E      Am      C     G   
All I see are dirty faces
	 F
Rain and wire
     C               G
And common sense in pieces
       E                 Am Em/G F   A   D
But I try to see through Irish eyes, Belfast

Look outside
Summer's lost and gone
It's a long walk
On a street of right and wrong
In every inch of sadness
Rocks and tanks
Go hand in hand with madness
But I never saw a braver place, Belfast

[Chorus]:
	G              D
And its sad when they sing
    Am           Em
And hollow ears listen
    G             D
Of smoking black roses
        Am           Em
On the streets of Belfast
    C            G
And so say your lovers
     Dm7	Am
>From under the flowers
       C            G
Every foot of this world
           F      A  D
Needs an inch of Belfast

Who's to say
On whom Heaven smiles
Our different ways
We try hard to recognise
No more enchanted evenings
The pubs are closed
And all the ghosts are leaving
But you'll never let them shut you down, Belfast

[Chorus]

    E  Bm    D       A
The enemy is not at home
          G5
A jealous green
F5       D5              A         Asus4     A
Streaks down this faulty diamond
      F#    Bm      D    A
No bloody boots or crucifix
         G                  D        A
Can ever hope to split this emerald island
       F#         Bm F#m/A G
But I never saw a braver place......
| E | Am Em/G | F | A D || 
.......................	Belfast

** The first part of the intro is played in 4/4 time, while the rest of the song 
is in 3/4 time
   Quite a complicated introduction, listen to the recording to figure out how 
to play it
