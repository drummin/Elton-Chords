IT'S ME THAT YOU NEED

INTRO: Am   G   F   E

Am                         G
Hey there look in the mirror
F                           C
Are you afraid you might see me
             G
Looking at you
Am                    G
Waiting, waiting at windows
         F
Oh it's me that you need
          C                         G
Yes it's me and I'm waiting for you
F                 C
But I remain silent
G          G7        C
Oh I won't say a word
F          F7      C             G           G7
I leave you to realize I'm the light in your world

C                                         G
And it's me, yes it's me, yes it's me, yes it's me
                  Am
That you're needing
F                                      C

If you want to be living

I'm the one who's forgiving
  C              G              C
Admit that it's me that you need

Am                                  G
Watching, watching the swallows fly
            F                        C
It all means the same just like them
                       G
You can fly home again
Am                                  G
But don't, no don't forget yesterday
F                        C
Pride is an ugly word girl
                           G
And you still know my name
F              C
But I remain silent
G         G7        C
Oh I won't say a word
F                 F7            C     G   G7
I leave you to realize I'm the light in your world
