I Don't Wanna Go On With You Like That
Music by Elton John
Lyrics by Bernie Taupin
Available on the album Reg Strikes Back

[Intro (where each || represents one measure of 4/4)]:
||: Am | Am | Dm7 | Dm7 :|| (repeat once)

Am
I've always said that one's enough to love
  Dm7				  G		A
Now I hear you're bragging one is not enough
			       Dm7
Something tells me you're not satisfied
	Gsus4			Am
You got plans to make me one of four or five

I guess this kind of thing's just in your blood
But you won't catch me counting up my love
I ain't no puzzle piece that needs to fit
If it takes more than me let's call it quits

[Chorus]:
Am						Dm7
`Cause I don't wanna go on with you like that
			 G		G7
Don't wanna be a feather in your cap
  C			      F7
I just wanna tell you honey I ain't mad
    G			     Am
But I don't wanna go on with you like that
[1st time]:
| Am | Am | Dm7 | Dm7 | G | G | Am | Am |
Woh...  Woh...  Woh...  Oh yeah...

[2nd/3rd time:]:
No I don't wanna go on with you like that
One more set of boots on your welcome mat
You'll just have to quit 'em if you want me back
`Cause I don't wanna go on with you like that
Woh...  Woh...  Woh...  Oh yeah...	(3rd time: go to Coda)

It gets so hard sometimes to understand
This vicious circle's getting out of hand
Don't need an extra eye to see
That the fire spreads faster in a breeze

[Chorus]

Oh if you wanna spread it around sister that's just fine
But I don't want no second hand feeding me lines
If you wanna hold someone in the middle of the night
Call out the guards, turn out the light

[Chorus]

[Coda]:
| Am | Am | Dm7 | Dm7 | G | G | Am | Am |
Woh...  Woh...  Woh...  Oh yeah...
(Repeat and Fade Coda)
