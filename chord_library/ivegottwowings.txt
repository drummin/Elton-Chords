I'VE GOT 2 WINGS - ELTON JOHN

INTRO
G - BbM7 - F F/E Dm - 

VERSE
  G
I am the elder Utah Smith
     Bb
I've got two wings to fly
     F
They may be made of paper
F/E      Dm
They may never reach the sky
    G
But I believe in mercy
    Bb
I believe that man is good
    A7      A7/C#    Dm
And if they want two wings like me
G         C           F
There's a chance they could

VERSE
  G
I am the elder Utah Smith
      Bb
I was born in Cedar Grove
       F
That's in Louisiana
F/E  Dm
On a dirt-poor stretch of road
  G/B
I found the calling early
     Bb
Gave birth to righteous words
    A7         Dm
And in a tent around the South
  G       C     F
I took my sonic church

CHORUS
        Bb            F
I was a light for the living
      C                  Dm
And I spoke of peace and love
         Bb               F
With two wings and my old Gibson
         C
I bought blessings from above
      Dm             Bb
I was here and I was gone
       F                  C
Just a heartbeat from the past
      Dm              G/B
But I went from paper wings
       Bb6           F
To the real thing at last

VERSE
  G
I am the elder Utah Smith
  Bb
I take all as they are
  F
I was the first man of the cloth
F/E F
To  blacken a guitar
G/B
Love was my redeemer
  Bb
I felt it from the start
    A7   A7/C#     Dm
The Holy Ghost was channeled
            G        C     F
Through the sound of my guitar

CHORUS
        Bb            F
I was a light for the living
      C                  Dm
And I spoke of peace and love
         Bb               F
With two wings and my old Gibson
         C
I bought blessings from above
      Dm             Bb
I was here and I was gone
       F                  C
Just a heartbeat from the past
      Dm              G/B
But I went from paper wings
       Bb6           F
To the real thing at last

BRIDGE
G
Been a long time in the ground
Bb6
Unmarked is my grave
    F                        F/E
But I reside elsewhere these days
Dm
Thanks to souls I've saved
  G/B
I traveled far, I traveled wide
Bb
Three quarts for the Lord
A7/C#    A7  A7/C# Dm
Till one day he    called me home
   G         C       F
To claim his great reward

CHORUS
        Bb            F
I was a light for the living
      C                  Dm
And I spoke of peace and love
         Bb               F
With two wings and my old Gibson
         C
I bought blessings from above
      Dm             Bb
I was here and I was gone
       F                  C
Just a heartbeat from the past
      Dm              G/B
But I went from paper wings
       Bb6           F
To the real thing at last

        Bb            F
I was a light for the living
      C                  Dm
And I spoke of peace and love
         Bb               F
With two wings and my old Gibson
         C
I bought blessings from above
      Dm             Bb
I was here and I was gone
       F                  C
Just a heartbeat from the past
      Dm              G/B
But I went from paper wings
       Bb6           F
To the real thing at last
