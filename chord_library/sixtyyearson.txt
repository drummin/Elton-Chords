Bm	       A		       G 	      Bm\F#
Who'll walk me down to church when I'm sixty years of age

	 Em				  F#
When the ragged dog they gave me has been ten years in the grave

Bm	     A		  G		   Bm\F#
And señorita play guitar, play it just for you

   Em			    F#			   Bm       A\B  E\B  D\B  Bm
My rosary has broken and my beads have all slipped through


Bm	       A		   G			 Bm\F#
You've hung up your great coat and you've laid down your gun

Em			       F#
You know the war you fought in wasn't too much fun

Bm		      A		      G		    Bm\F#
And the future you're giving me holds nothing for a gun

     Em			  F#	      Bm  A\B  E\B  D\B  Bm  
I've no wish to be living sixty years on

Bm  A\B  E\B  D\B  Bm  

(D  C  E  Am)**  Bm  A\B  E\B  D\B  Bm  


Bm		  A			G	     Bm\F#
Yes I'll sit with you and talk let your eyes relive again

Em				   F#
I know my vintage prayers would be very much the same

Bm	      A		       G		 Bm\F#
And Magdelena plays the organ, plays it just for you

Em					F#
Your choral lamp that burns so low when you are passing through


Bm		      A		      G		    Bm\F#
And the future you're giving me holds nothing for a gun

Em			  F#	      Bm  
I've no wish to be living sixty years on
