I know that the competition's heavy.  I know that these guys are cool.

But I'll show this kid is more than ready.  I sure got something to prove.

Right now I'm just another guy.  I don't mean nothing to them.

But when they see me dance, when they see me dance...

     when you see me dance, when you see me dance
