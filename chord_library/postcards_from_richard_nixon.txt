Verse 1:
C        F*/C  F/C C                 Bb/C    F/C C
We heard Rich--ard Nixon say, welcome to the US--A
    G/B            Am
The common sense I sometimes lack
    Dm          G
Has opened up a seismic crack
      C/E             F          G    (Gsus4)
We've fallen in and I can't pull back
      Ab          Bb      C    (F*/C F/C C)
And I guess we'll have to stay

C       F*/C F/C C                        Bb/C  F/C     C
In open arms we  put our trust they put us on a big red bus
     G/B             Am
Twin spirits soaking up a dream
Dm               G
Fuel to feed the press machine
      C/E             F        G
After years that were long and lean
      Ab      Bb     C
We're finally on our way


Chorus:
    D/A             E                 Am           C/G
And Richard Nixon's on his knees he's sent so many overseas
             F                        G                C
He'd like to know if you and me could help him in some way
         F              D/F#             G    G#mflat5 Am
A little camouflage and glue to mask the evil that men do
 (/G)   F         C/E       Bb   F
A small diversion caused by two, pale kids come to play
    G                           Ab             Bb C
And we heard Richard Nixon say "welcome to the US-A"


Verse 2:
C       F*/C F/C C                         Bb        F/A  C
Neither of   us  understood the way things ticked in Hollywood
        G/B           Am
We just loaded in and grabbed the bat
     Dm             G
With little room to swing a cat
    C/E                 F          G
And pretty soon we were where it's at
   Ab     Bb     C
Or so the papers say

C       F*/C   F/C C                       Bb        F/A   C
And all around us  suntanned teens, beauty like we'd never seen
    G/B           Am
Our heroes led us by the hand
        Dm             G
Through Brian Wilson's promised land
      C/E              F      G
Where Disney's God and he commands
     Ab       Bb     C
Both mice and men to stay

[Chorus]

     Eb                    Dm           C
In a bright red Porsche on Sunset I saw Steve McQueen
  Eb                        Dm               C
I guess he's just about the coolest guy I've ever seen
        F               D/F#            G                 G#mflat5
And for you and me that speeding car is how it's going to be
         Am               D7               G
I see no brakes just open road and lots of gasoline


C        F*/C  F/C C                 Bb/C    F/C C
We heard Rich--ard Nixon say, welcome to the US--A
    G/B            Am
The common sense I sometimes lack
    Dm          G
Has opened up a seismic crack
      C/E             F          G   
We've fallen in and I can't pull back

F
Pale kids come to play
    G                                      Ab     Bb      C
And we heard Richard Nixon say, I've gotta go but you can stay

| Eb | Dm | C | (x2)

| C | Fsus4/C F/C C | Ab Bb | F C | (x2)
