  A                A7           D
I wonder who's sleeping in your sheets tonight

A                     A7  D
Whose head rests upon the bed

A                   A7       D
Could it be a close friend I knew so well

G
Who seems to be so close to you instead

G	         D    G  D
Close to you instead


    A             A7      D
I'm blue tonight, I'm red when I'm mad

    A                  A7          D
I'm green when I'm jealous, yellow when I'm sad

A            A7       D
I guess I cannot have everything

G
So much has flown between the years

	   G                        D
When I was twenty and you were seventeen


F			 Bb
So out of choice I chose rock and roll

       F			   Bb
But it pushed me to the limit everyday

	  C7+\B                     Am7
It turned me into a gypsy, kept me away from home

Eb		     Cm		       Ab
From there on, there seemed no use for you

	   G7
For you to stay


    A           A7     D
And if I shower 'round 3 a.m.

A                 A7 D
It's just to wash a- way

    A               A7 D
The trace of a love un-wanted

G
Oh in the times I went astray

    G		  D
The times I went astray

(CHORUS)

(INSTRUMENTAL)

    A             A7      D
I'm blue tonight, I'm red when I'm mad

    A                  A7          D
I'm green when I'm jealous, yellow when I'm sad

A            A7       D
I guess I cannot have everything

G
So much has flown between the years

	   G                        D
When I was twenty and you were seventeen

A A7  D 
Oh, oh,

A A7  D 
Oh, oh,

A A7  D 
Oh, oh,

G
So much has flown between the years

	     G			    D
When I was twenty and you were seventeen
