---Intro---

G7 - C7 - G7 - C7


---V1---

G
Hey how about this

Gm7
A little conversation tonight 

Eb		      Bb
Thinking aloud how we struggled to find 

F			C
Our place in the dizzy heights


---V2---

Don't often do this 
We never really get the chance 
Nearly froze to death on Oxford Street 
Now we're sitting in the South of France


---Bridge 1---

		     Am7
Talking through the evening 

			Em7
It's good to shoot the breeze 

              C	     G/B
Just you and me on a balcony 

     A/C#		   G/D
And cicadas singing in the trees


---chorus---

     G	       D/F#	   Em7
Old '67 what a time it was 

       G/D         C		 Eb   F     G    
What a time of innocence, what a time we've lost 

			 D/F#		F	C/E
Raise a glass and have a laugh, have a laugh or two

	  Eb		  F 
Here's to old '67 and an older me and you


G7 - C7 - G7 - C7


---V3---

Sentimental twilight 
Conversing on those virgin days 
Laughing about how the two of us sound 
Like a Tennessee Williams play


---V4---

Honest, it's amazing 
That we can get together at all 
For in between the saddle and the grand piano 
We can read the writing on the wall


---Bridge 2---

Talking through the evening 
Sitting here side by side 
Just you and me on a balcony 
It's a little bit funny this feeling inside


[Chorus]


G7 - C7 - G7 - C7


[Bridge Instrumental]


[Chorus]


---Final line---

	  Am7  Eb	 F 
Here's to old '67 and an older me and you


G7 - C7 - G7 - C7
