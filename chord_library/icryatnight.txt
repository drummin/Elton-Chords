INTRO


Eb Bb Db Ab (x2)


VERSE 1


     Db           Ab/C           Bbm
This house that I live in has no reason

     Gb           Db              Ab/Db   Ab
This house that I sleep in has no purpose

         Bbm               Gb
It has a bed and a few old chairs

              Bbm		 Gb     Db Ab
Three flights up, two flights of stairs

   	      Bbm
But it has no reason


     Db/Bbm  Ab/Db            Eb
Then someone shot through the tyre swing

                    Db/Bbm       Ab/Db      Eb
The dogs barked and bayed in the winter and spring

        Gb                      Ab
And the ivy that hung now sadly clings

           Bbm
To a dying season


CHORUS


    G\C      D/C            C             G\B
And I cry at night when the lights go out

        G\C        D/C          C         G\B
And the green eyes fuse and the full moon shouts

     Am7/F     		        G\Am7 Am7
From road maps and red lines to lipstick lies

             Eb        Bb       Db          Ab
And when the lights go out it's tough to survive


Eb Bb Db Ab


VERSE 2


     Db          Ab/C              Bbm
This man holds a hand that shows a tremble

     Gb         Db                Ab/Db  Ab
This man that I live in bears his faults

         Bbm		            Gb
He has a heart and a well worn soul

            Bbm		      Gb   Db Ab
Ten years a slave to Rock And Roll

              Bbm
But he has to tremble


        Db/Bbm Ab/Db        Eb
For the yellow grass on the sun burnt lawn

              Db/Bbm         Ab/Db     Eb
Sleeps in her seeds from the sunset to dawn

    Gb					Ab
And just like your love that's come and gone

           Bbm
It goes on breathing


CHORUS


    G\C      D/C            C             G\B
And I cry at night when the lights go out

        G\C        D/C          C         G\B
And the green eyes fuse and the full moon shouts

     Am7/F     		        Am7
From road maps and red lines to lipstick lies

             Eb        Bb       Db          Ab
And when the lights go out it's tough to survive

          Eb           Bb       Db          Ab
And when the lights go out it's tough to survive
