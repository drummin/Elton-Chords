INTRO: Bb/F / / Bbsus/F     C / / /


Bb/F                          C                 Bb/F                     
C
I read about how you're slow  -  with the truth  -  like any old 
Aesop's Fable.
Bb/F                            C                 Bb/F                    
C
But when you're turtlesque, I'm   a hare's breath  into payment under 
the table.
Bb/F                         C            Bb/F                           
C
But some journalist got his mug shot kit       and his briefcase on his 
lap.
Bb/F                                   C      Bb/F                          
C
But I'm tired of being linked with the K.G.B.   -   and all that 
political crap.



CHORUS:
Bb                     F       C     Bb                     F        C
`Cause I've seen your fascist faces  -  on the cover of the national 
papers.
Bb       F                C     Bb                     F                  
C
Staring out in black and white  -  from the tall gray walls on the 
other side.
Bb               F       C     Bb         F             C
When I see your fascist faces  -  then I know I've had enough.
Bb         F           C        Bb         F              C
Trying to trace it or erase it.     Is it foolproof or a bluff?

Bb/F                                         C
If the boy had been blessed he'd have been arrested
Bb/F                             C
     on a charge of wearing red shoes.
Bb/F                                C
But if your pants are blue you got  -  nothing to lose.
Bb/F                                  C
It'll make you a patriot through and through.
