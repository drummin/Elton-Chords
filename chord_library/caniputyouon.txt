(G  F C  G  G  C G

G  F C  G  G  C)*


  G						G\F
I work for the foundry for a penny and a half a day 

	 C		       G	      C\G  G
Like a blind street musician I never see those who pay 

     Am		    C
It's dirty work in Birmingham 

       C
Better deal for a Sheffield man 

	  G			  Am
If he can rivet then his kids can buy 

C		     C   C C G
Candy from the candy man 


	F		      C
And the van that comes around weekends 

	F	     C
Selling fancy city things 

F			 C
Sold by the man with the trilby hat 

	F		     C\E
And the whiskers spread like wings 

		 Am7
You can hear him sing 

		     D
Oh you can hear him sing 

	         G G\A 		G\B	C  F\C
Can I put you on,  people can I put you on 

C			 G
Tell you that I love you people 

		  F		   C  G\B  Am7  C C G
Sing a salesman's song and put you on 


      G					       G\F
And a second cousin works in the pits in Newcastle on Tyne 

       C				       G
And he don't care if it rains outside, there's coal dust on his mind 

     Am		   C
It's dirty work in Manchester 

	C		    C
But the crew gets paid its gelt 

G		    Am
Bang on the bell on Friday 

C				C	C C G
You buys a little something for yourself 

	F		      C
And the van that comes around weekends 

(CHORUS)

(CHORUS)

  G    G\F  C                         G
Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  People can I put you on?
(REPEAT, AD LIB, FADE)


*Intro should be played with a guitar, if possible.

If this is not possible, Elton uses similar chords on the live 11-17-70 album, but it sounds very different.
See that recording for more info.
