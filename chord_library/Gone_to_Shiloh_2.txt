Verse1: Dm                       F/C        Bb
        Luther left us, first light, Friday morning.
        Dm                   F/C      Bb
        Little Dan and Becky waved goodbye.
                      G7
        They're gonna have to share the weight together.
        E                     A                Dm      (Dm    Am/C)
        Idle hands will see a good farm slowly die.



Chorus: Bb                     F
        Gone to Shiloh for the Union.
                    C         A/C#    Dm       (Dm     Am/C)
        Shoulder to shoulder, side by side.
        Bb              F    C/E     Dm
        Gone to Shiloh, Hope springs eternal,
             A7                A/C#     Dm
        When flags and bullets start to fly.


(Repeat Band Intro)


Verse2: Dm                              F/C        Bb
        April's come and the air smells fresh with rain.
             Dm                       F/C       Bb
        They watched his shadow fade around the bend.
                    Gm7
        He's headed for a different kind of thunder
                E                       A             Dm     (Dm    Am/C)
        and the stunned surprise in the eyes of dying men.


(Repeat Chorus)

Verse3:     Dm                         F/C       Bb
        The old black rooster sang him down that dirt road.
            Dm                           F/C   Bb
        His step seemed bold, his manner fancy free.
                  Gm7       
        I pray we see him 'live and well in the fall here,
        E                      A             Dm       (Dm     Am/C)
        Than that god forsaken place in Tennessee.


(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge: G/B                Gm/Bb
        After all of this, if we should prevail.
        G/B                        A            A/C#   Dm
        Heaven help the south when Sherman comes their way.
