          G     Am7         G             Em    D      G
Well she swept through the church like a sweet Sunday prayer.
           C                  G                Em                   D
While the choir sang "Son of Heaven", and the groom just walked on air.
      G       Am7       G               Em      D       G
I was killing time with Jesus when the wedding bells began.
       C                      G             Am           Em       G   D-Em7/D-D
And I saw the most beautiful woman getting married to a handsome man.


CHORUS:

She walked like a mystery.  And she passed like summer rain.
         Eb                 Bb            Gm7   F/G      F
And she said "I do" like an angel.  But I never knew her name.
       Bb    Eb/Bb  Bb               Gm7      F    F
Oh the congregation gathered, but in darkness I remained.
    Eb                       Cm  Bb  F/A                         Bb  Eb/Bb
In love with the bride of a handsome man - but I never knew her name.



        G     Am7     G            Em       D         G
In the shadow of the holy - oh, I heard my tell-tale heart.
         C                G                 Em                 D
Whisper words that never reached her as her vows were made at last.
        G        Am7       G          Em           D        G
Oh, the preacher with his blessing pronounced them man and wife.
       C                      G           Am            Em       G   D-Em7/D-D
And I saw the most beautiful woman make a promise to be kept for life.
