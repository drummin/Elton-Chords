The Panic In Me
Music by Elton John
Lyrics by Tim Rice
Available on the album soundtrack The Road To El Dorado

F    F9
	     C
Often these days
	     Dm
And always these nights
      F/C    Bb
I find I'm afraid
		  F      Bb/F   F
Of the turbulent heights
	       C
No matter how crazily
	      Dm
No matter how far
	   F/C	 Bb	   F/A
The moments of tenderness
		    Gm7  	C
Are those where you are

Chorus:
		  Dm
For when you are laughing
	     A7
Like silver, like rain
		   Bb
You cool me, you soothe me
	     Gm7	C
And love me again
		   F
For a few perfect hours
	   A7
The world lets me be
		Bb	 F/A
You know how to calm down,
    Gm7  C
Oh oh
	     Dm		A7
The panic in me
	     Dm		A7
The panic in me
	     Dm		A7
The panic in me
	     Bb	  F/A 	Gm7	F
The panic in me

Once in a while
I slip back to my past
Where I long to remain
But the dream does not last
In the trials of the present
No matter how low
You bring me such peace
And you won't let me go

For when you are laughing
Like silver, like rain
You cool me, you soothe me
And love me again
For a few perfect hours
The world lets me be
You know how to break down
Oh oh
The panic in me
The panic in me
The panic in me
The panic in me

In the trials of the present
No matter how low
You bring me such peace
And you won't let me go
Oh don't let me go

For when you are laughing
Like silver, like rain
You cool me, you soothe me
And love me again
For a few perfect hours
The world lets me be
You know how to break down
Oh oh
The panic in me
The panic in me
The panic in me
The panic in me

The panic in me...
