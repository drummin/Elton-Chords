C           G\B		      Am
I'd like to make this song so simple

Dm	      C		      G\B
Don't want to hide my feeling under

F		  F\C		 C
Drawn up words in shades of many colours

			       Bb
How can I make them think I am clever

			Bb\F F
By merely saying that I miss you


C	    G\B			 Am
It's just a state they claim I'm going through

Dm		  C		  G\B
Don't want you to think that I am weakening

F		      
Although you know I'm always dreaming

C			     Bb
Someday you'll be coming home to me


Cm Dm     Eb   Em7     F	Eb F      Bb
Tortured, I've been so tortured by you so many times

	Cm		Eb        Em7
But you always love the ones that hurt you

F	    Eb	  F	  Bb
And I guess those are the ties that bind

Cm Dm	 Eb F
Tortured by you

C	 G\B	       Am
If I had taken parting easy

Dm	      C		    G
It might have been a better lesson

    F
For all concerned in wars of love and hate

C				    Bb
How can you swear through words and music

			       Bb\F F
The heart you crave and how to move it


C	    G\B			     Am
It's just a beach you washed my body onto

Dm		  C		 G
Don't want you to know that I an crying

  F
Although your friends can see I'm dying

C				  Bb
Slowly from the knife you left in me

(CHORUS)

C  G\B  Am

C	    G\B			     Am
It's just a beach you washed my body onto

Dm		  C		 G
Don't want you to know that I an crying

Although your friends can see I'm dying

C				  Bb
Slowly from the knife you left in me

(CHORUS)

Cm Dm    Eb F
Tortured by you

Cm Dm    Eb F
Tortured by you

Cm Dm    Eb F      Bb
Tortured by you so many times
