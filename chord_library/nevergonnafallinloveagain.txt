I got a brand-new problem   -   pretty and she's 5 foot 10.

I been in love three times this week - I'm just about to fall again.

Never meant to be so sexist.   It's so hard to overcome.
C      G        B         Em        E                   A
Trying hard to fight the feeling - lechery can be such fun.
Bm                      G       D     A                  G        D
Cuz everywhere there's lots of foxes,   and every cat I meet's a tom.
C           G      B      Em         E                         A
I wish she didn't make me rabid.   I wish she wouldn't turn me on.
