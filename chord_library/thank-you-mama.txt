        C
Now the world has turned away
              E7           Am Gm F
My life gets colder every day
          Em          Dm7 G7
You don't know how it is
       C
I lost all my will to live
                  E7            Am   Gm  F
You've taken the love I have to give
          Em          Dm7 G7
You don't know how it is

chorus:
          C  Bb     F        F6     G7
Thank you Mama, you ease to please again
          C  Bb    F        F6     G7
You know Mama, you take the pain away
         C            E7
Oh it's sad but not so bad
         Am       Gm     F  F6
Make me lose the blues I had
          C  Bb	    F        F6      C
Thank you Mama, you ease to please again

Well Sunday comes along with the wind
       E7                   Am  Gm F
Every Sunday was spent with him
          Em          Dm7 G7
You don't know how it is
          C
We would watch the flames burn higher
        E7               Am Gm F
Tell me Mama started to cry
           Em         Dm7 G7
You don't know how it is

(repeat chorus)

            C
You see my honesty was wrong
               E7              Am  Gm  F
'Cause you've known me for so long
        Em         Dm7  G7
Oh you know how it is
         C
Lost and won on down the line
        E7              Am  Gm  F
And you always stood behind
        Em         Dm7  G7
Oh you know how it is

(repeat chorus)
