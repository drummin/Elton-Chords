intro:
Db  Ab  Eb  Ab  Ab7  Db  Ab  Eb  Ab

Eb                       Db/F
Lipstick and lashes, the traces of stardom
    Gb                   Db                 Eb
Lit up on a billboard so everyone sees them in neon
Eb                     Db/F
Behind the counter she stares out the window
Gb                         Db              Eb
Up at the billboard that's like a reminder in neon
    Ab                          Gb
She hates how she feels but she hangs like a mirror
Bbm                    Fm                  Eb
Maybe a stranger could walk in and see her in neon
Fm                            C
For two cents of danger she'd trust anybody
      Bbm                    Eb
She'd smoke like a gun if it meant she might wind up

Ab          Cm                  Bb                Ebsus4   Eb
In neon the dreams in the light of a promise that dies
  Ab/Gb      Db/F    Ab/Eb                 Eb
A shimmering city, a glimmer of hope and a lie
   Ab       Cm                  Db               Eb
In neon the name's gone there's no reason why anymore
Ab/Gb          Ab/Gb           Eb            Ab    Db  Ab  Eb
Trust them and wind up alone behind a locked door

Eb   Ab  Db  Ab  Eb       Ab
In neon,             in neon


Pictures and patterns, the touches of glamour
Cut into a fashion that flashes above them in neon
A hot cup of coffee held in her fingers
A perfect complexion that lingers above her in neon


She hates how she feels but she hangs like a mirror
Maybe a stranger could walk in and see her in neon
For a shot at the title, she'd slip into something
She'd smoulder like ashes if it meant she might wind up in neon


Ab          Cm                  Bb                Ebsus4   Eb
In neon the dreams in the light of a promise that dies
  Ab/Gb      Db/F    Ab/Eb      Eb         Ab    Ab7  Db  Ab  Eb
A shimmering city, a glimmer of hope and a lie

    Ab
In neon
