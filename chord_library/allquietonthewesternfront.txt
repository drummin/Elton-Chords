C  F\C  G\C  C  F\C  G\C  

C   C\E          F	       Dm\G F\C  C 
All quiet on the Western Front, no- body saw

C	 C\E	      F		    Dm\G F\G        C
A youth asleep in the foreign soil, plan-ted by the war

F\C      F\C	  C	F     F   G\F C
Feel the pulse of human blood pouring forth

F\C	F\C	 C	F    F G\F C     Bb\C
See the stems of Europe bend under force

Bb  Gm
All quiet

Em  Am
All quiet

    C\G          G       C
All quiet on the Western Front


C  C\E           F            Dm\G F    C
So tired of this garden's grief, no-  body cares

C	C\E	 F		   Dm\G 	   F     C
Old kin kiss the small white cross,     their only souvenir

F\C	F\C	 C       F    F       G\F C
See the Prussian offense fly, weren't we  grand

   F\C       F\C     C          F     F  G\F   C     C\Bb
To place the feel of cold sharp steel in their hands

(CHORUS)

C	      C\E 	   F		 Dm\F  F      C
It's gone all quiet on the Western Front, male angels sigh

C      C\E	  F              Dm\F  F    C
Ghosts float in a flooded trench as Germany dies

F\C   F\C       C          F       F    G\F    C
Fever reaps the flowers of France, fair-haired boys

F\C	   F\C	    C         F      F  G\F C    C\Bb
String the harps to Victory's voice, joyous noise

(CHORUS 2x)
