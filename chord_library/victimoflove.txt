Ebm	 Bbm	
You said you'd never fake it

Ebm	  Bbm 		      Abm7\Gb
You swore we'd always make it last

       Ab	  Bb
And it sounded so real

    Ebm	   Bbm		  
And I fell into your love trap

Ebm         Bbm		      Abm7\Gb
Lying, yes, I was the perfect fool

    Ab           Bb
I believed every word

       Ab      Bb	 Ebm
And it never occurred to me

	  Bb\D              Db
Is this a game are you just playing

	  Cm        B  Bb
Will I be losing you


       Ebm	    B               Bb
Oh am I a victim of love, victim of love

		      Ebm
Did you take me for a ride

	  B		  Bb
Victim of love, victim of love

		             Ebm
Then I hope you're satisfied

	  B		  Bb
Victim of love, victim of love

		    Ebm
Were you only using me

	  B		  Bb
Victim of love, victim of love

			Ebm  Bbm  Ebm  Bbm  
What a fool you made of me


Ebm	   Bbm
My friends warned me about you

Ebm	   Bbm			  Abm7\Gb
I laughed, how could I doubt your love

       Ab	    Bb
Then I saw you with him

    Ebm	     Bbm
And my world crumbled around me

Ebm    Bbm		   Abm7\Gb
I felt life slip away from me

	  Ab	      Bb
There's a void inside me

	 Ab	 	Bb
Where my heart used to be

   Ebm		   Bb\D		      Db
So now, this was a game you were just playing

	    Cm	       B  Bb
And now I'm losing you


   Ebm		       B	   Bb
Oh I'm a victim of love, victim of love

			Ebm
Well you took me for a ride

	      B		  Bb
Victim of love, victim of love

			 Ebm
Well I hope you're satisfied

	      B		  Bb
Victim of love, victim of love

		      Ebm
You were only using me

	      B		  Bb
Victim of love, victim of love

			     Ebm  Bb\D  Db  Cm  B  Bb
What a fool you've made of me
