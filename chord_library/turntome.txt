        G                          Bm
Turn to me, turn to me when you're lonely
            C                 D
Brush them aside, gather your pride

Baby turn to me

Turn to me, turn to me when you're lonely

Brush them aside, gather your pride

Baby turn to me

      C             D
Don't listen to the people
           Em
Who spread lies about your name
          C
I know it hurts
    D                Em
But baby I've had it too

                Bm
I've learned to live with their abuse
                C
I've learned to live with those who choose
   Am                         Am7/D
To disregard my emptiness and lose me

(to chorus)

        Bm        
But you seem to be happy just for now to go on
       C              
Try to see through them baby, can't you see what is wrong
       A7
You're hurting yourself more that you'll ever know
       D                     Em/D        D      E
You're pushing the people to tell you to go

(to chorus and transpose up one whole step)
