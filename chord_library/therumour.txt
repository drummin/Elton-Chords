   F                                                  /D - /C
1) This is the last time I'll look across this table -
2) There was a tide turning somewhere deep inside us.
3) As   the   rain   falls   I   listen   to  the radio -

   F                                         Gm/Bb   Bb      Eb/Bb - Bb
1)    and try to face a feeling I don't even recog - nize.
2) When all these years together seem lost behind my tears.
3) and try to memorize the words to "Georgia On My Mind"

   C                                           Dm/C   F/C
1) This is a sad hand that reached across and touched you,
2) Oh there were good times but in between the dog    days -
3) But we're no old song we never stood the    test   of   time.

     C                                            Bb/F    F        Bb/F
  1) when all we'd built around us came crashing  to  the ground
  2)     I  felt  the  pain  of  rumour  whisper  in  my  ears.
  3)    The lies inside the rumour left trust so  far  be-hind.


CHORUS:
F     Cm/A                     D7               Gm7
But I still tried to love you, I still tried to care.
Bbm                                          F       /D  /C-/D   F
Still tried to hold on with the power of my prayers.
        Cm/A                         D7                   Gm7    Bbm
But you can't fight the rumour - you can't argue with you heart, no.
F    G   Ab   F/A   Bb     Bbsus   Bb   F    G   Ab   F/A  Bb     Bbsus  Bb
Once the ru - mour spreads,             once the ru - mour spreads,

F    G   Ab   F/A   Bb     Bbsus   Bb     Bbm                          F {intro}
Once the ru - mour spreads,           the truth is just a thing of the past.



Ab                  Eb   Bb                    F
And when we say goodbye,    be sure to look me in the eye.
Ab                Eb             Gm7             Csus    C
And know the real secret was the thing we didn't have to hide.


{Repeat Chorus}
