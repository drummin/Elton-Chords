Showboat coming up the river.   See her lanterns flicker in the gentle breeze.
E                                      A        D
I can hear the crickets singing in the evening.
    F#m        G               D
Old Dixie Lily moving past the cypress trees.
E                        A     D
My little boat she rocks easy.
          F#m              E                 A
I've been catching catfish in the creek all day.
            E                                    A         D
Oh and I've never seen ladies like those on the big boats.
        F#m            G                   D
Must be fancy breeding lets you live that way.



CHORUS:
A                            D/A
Dixie Lily, chugging like a grand old lady.
A                                    E7  *  *  D/F# - E7/G#
Paddles hitting home in the noon-day sun.
A                      A/G  D/F#                F
Ploughing through the water with your whistles blowing -
B7              E7                    A  {Intro}
Down from Louisiana on the Vicksburg run.



E                    A        D           F#m            E            A
Papa says that I'm a dreamer.   Says them skeetas bit me one too many times.
          E                                A       D
Oh, but I never get lonesome living on the river.
F#m                G                 D
Watching old Lily leave the world behind.


{Repeat Chorus}

      ...run.  Oh,  down from Louisiana on the Vicksburg run.
