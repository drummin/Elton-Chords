        G                                     B
Your bag's out on the bed.  Your closet's all
                         C
cleared out.  You say you're going to
                               A
Jacksonville 'cause our love is all worn out.
          G                               B
You're searching in my eyes to try and find a
                   C                                  A
tear, but the will of my forgiveness has dried
                                  C
up with the years.  You might still look pretty
          Bb                          Am
in that lacy little dress, but I think you've
                                          D
got your signals crossed if you think that I'm a
                           G                       D
mess. I 'aint gonna die.  I 'aint gonna cry.  I
                       C             G/B  A
won't wear my heart out on my sleeve.  You can
             F                                      B
take the car, but you won't break my heart.  Oh,
                            C                          D   D/E
and darlin, turn the lights out when you leave.
                  G                           D
I 'aint gonna shake.  I 'aint gonna break.
                  C                     A
I 'aint gonna fall down on my knees, so, if
                          F
everything's been said, I'm headin' back to
B                                        C          D  D/E
bed.  Oh, and darlin, turn the lights out when
D/F# G           G
you leave.  It's like a primetime movie.  You
B                                    C
play the part so well.  You do believe you're
                         A                        G
heaven-sent, and livin' here is hell.  I hear
                                  B
it's hot in florida and it's rainin' here
                       C
tonight, but the sun's gonna shine tomorrow, and
     A                              C
I'm gonna do alright.  You might still look
                   Bb                           Am
pretty in that lacy little dress, but I think
                                                    D
you've got your signals crossed if you think that
               D/E  D/F#
I'm a mess.
                  G                        D
I 'aint gonna die.  I 'aint gonna cry.  I won't
             C                      A
wear my heart out on my sleeve.  You can take the
F                                       B
car, but you won't break my heart.  Oh, and
                      C                          D   D/E D/F#
darlin, turn the lights out when you leave.  I
                 G                          D
'aint gonna shake.  I 'aint gonna break.  I 'aint
          C                     A
gonna fall down on my knees, so if everythings
        F                                B
been said, I'm headin back to bed.  Oh, and
                     C          D  D/E D/F#   G
darlin, turn the lights out when you    leave.

You might still look pretty in that lacy little
                 Am
dress, but I think you've got your signals
                     D                          D/E  D/F#
crossed if you think that I'm a mess.

So, if everything's been said, I'm headin back to
B                                    C          D D/E D/F#
bed.  And, darlin, turn the lights out when you
G       C  G/B  C/A  G  C G
leave.
