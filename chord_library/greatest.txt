G
Peering out of tiny eyes
Bm/F#
The grubby hands that gripped the rail
F
Wiped the window clean of frost
C/E			       G
As the morning air laid on the latch

G
A whistle awakened someone there
Bm/F#
Next door to the nursery just down the hall
F
A strange new sound you never heard before
C/E                               G
A strange new sound that makes boys explore

G
Tread neat so small those little feet
Bm/F#
Amid the morning his small heart beats
F
So much excitement yesterday
C/E                              G
That must be rewarded must be displayed

Am				 D           D/C
Large hands lift him through the air
Bm7			Esus - E
Excited eyes contain him there
C			     G
The eyes of those he loves and knows
F				Dsus    D7
But what's this extra bed just here

G
His puzzled head tipped to one side
Bm/F#
Amazement swims in those bright green eyes
F
Glancing down upon this thing
C/E                              G
That make strange sounds, strange sounds that sing

G
In those silent happy seconds
Bm/F#
That surround the sound of this event
F
A parent smile is made in moments
C/E                       G
They have made for you a friend

Am				 Dsus   D
And all you ever learned from them
Bm7			Esus  E
Until you grew much older
Am			 C
Did not compare with when they said
G		  Bm  Em	G7
This is your brand new brother
Cmaj9		 D6   G     D/F#
This is your brand new brother
Cmaj7/E	      Dsus D	G
This is your brand new brother
