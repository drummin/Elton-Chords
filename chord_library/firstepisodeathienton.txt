Gm                         F                                  Eb
I was one as you were one, and we were two so much in love forever.
                        Bb
I loved the white socks that you wore.
                         Gm7/Eb                      Dm
But you don't wear white socks no more, now you're a woman.
  Gm                               F
I joked about your turned-up nose, criticized your school girl clothes-
Eb                                           Bb          Gm7/Eb | Dsus  D  |
but would I then have paced these roads - to love you?



BRIDGE:
Asus   A            Dm           Asus             A7sus - A7  Dm
   For seasons come & seasons go.  Bring forth the rain     -    the sun & snow-
                    Gm                      F
     make Valerie a woman.   And Valerie is lonely.




Em                     Am
No more to roam on the snow hills of Hienton.
    Em                              Am
Undecided with the guardians of the older generation.
   F                            C
A doormat was a sign of welcome - in the winter months to come.
           Dm                          Am
And in the summer laughing through the castle ruins we'd run.



Em                             Am                        Em
For the quadrangle sang to the sun, and the grace of our feeling -
                       F
And the candle burned low.
                    C                     Dm  
As we talked of the future underneath the ceiling.



Gm                          F                                   Eb
There were tears in the sky & the clouds in your eyes were just cover.
                         Bb                      Gm7/Eb         Dsus - D
For your thighs were the cushions of my love and yours for each other.


{Repeat Bridge, then Intro}



Bb                        Ab
The songs still are sung.    It was fun to be young.
     Eb              F            Gm
But please don't be sad where you are.
                 F                      Eb     
I am who I am.   You are who you are.
Bb/D                 Gm7/Eb    Bb/D                  Gm7/Eb
     Now Valerie's a woman.          Now Valerie's a woman.
Bb/D                 Gm7/Eb  Bb/D   Gm7/Eb   {Repeat Intro - end in Gm}
     Now Valerie's a   wo     -     man.
