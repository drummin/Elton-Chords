Did Anybody Sleep With Joan of Arc?
(B side from "This Train Don't Stop there Anymore")

Intro: Gm F Eb Gm F Eb

   Gm                              Eb 
At seventeen, she became the queen of Orleans

  Bb                        Cm    
A peasant child guided by a vivid dream

Ab                                 Eb
She was cool before they knew what cool became

Ab                   Cm/G               F 
She cut her hair and cross-dressed in a dangerous age


She set a trend, a natural look was all the rage
Imagine if they had merchandise and poster sales
This bride of God, bigger than Elvis in her day
She had it all until they burned it all away

Chorus:

    Db
She swung a sword

    Ab
She rode a horse

    Bbm                    Gb
She wore her armor for the Lord

    Db             Ab 
But did she cry by candlelight

               Bbm
Was she lonely after dark

        Bbm/Ab             Gb
Did she pray for something more

    Db      Ab         Bbm Gb  Db  
Did anybody sleep with Joan Of Arc

Tacit:

She was small and more or less of common breed
But saint aside, no stranger to a woman's needs
No handsome knights, no random acts of chivalry
Her bed remained a simple place for her to sleep


     Ab                  Ab/C
They burned her down for her belief

     Gb              Db   
They burned her down for her faith

     Ab            Ab/C   
They gave her up into the flames

    Gb                  Db/Gb    Ab
For claiming she's seen heaven's face




     Ab                  Ab/C
They burned her down for her belief

     Gb              Db   
They burned her down for her faith

     Ab            Ab/C   
They gave her up into the flames

    Gb                  Db
For claiming she's seen heaven's face

     Ab                  Ab/C
They burned her down for her belief

     Gb              Db   
They burned her down for her faith

     Ab            Ab/C   
They gave her up into the flames

    Gb                  Db/Gb    Ab
For claiming she's seen heaven's face


    Db      Ab         Bbm Gb  Db  
Did anybody sleep with Joan Of Arc
