Intro: Cm7sus - Bb/D     Eb(add F)


Bb              F/A              Ab     Eb/G
Holding all the pictures that my life's drawn,
Bb      F/A               Ab   Eb/G  F/A
I never find I'm missing love.
  Bb               F/A                Ab     Eb/G
Remembering all parades that had been rained on -
  Bb           F/A             Ab   Eb/G
     but never cloudy leaving love.



BRIDGE:
Cm7            Bb/D             Fsus      F - Gm7
Ask me what it is that makes it special.
Cm7         Bb/D    Fsus
Why it's so real to me.



CHORUS:
F   -   Gm7 - F/A   Bb              F/A          Eb
  It's know - ing   who keeps their place in my heart.
      F      Bb        F/A   Abmaj7
It's knowing how is it I can feel you.
Eb       F      Bb           F/A       Eb
   It's knowing never will I change my mind.
                    Ab   Eb               Ab   Bb
When I think about love,    I think about you.
Ab            Eb                       Ab   Bb   Eb/F
When I think about love, I think about you.


Bb                  F/A                Ab     Eb/G
Too many times I've turned my emotions on and off -
Bb             F/A           Ab   Eb/G  F/A
   without realizing what it does.
    Bb                       F/A           Ab      Eb/G
You know what's moved me and kept me going    this far -
          Bb          F/A               Ab   Eb/G
     but  -  I never questioned what it was.
