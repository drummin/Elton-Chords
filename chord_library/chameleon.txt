Chameleon
by: Elton John

Intro: G - Bm/F# - Em - G/D - C - G/B - Am7 - Bm - C/D

G           Bm/F#    Em   G/D
The last I heard of you
           C             G/B          Am7          C   	         
You were somewhere on a cruise in the Mediterranean
D/G       Bm/F#  Em  G/D           C         G/B
So imagine my surprise to see you very much alive
                Am7	   E7
In the English rain again

                             Am
And I can still recall wet afternoons 
C/G                             D
When we were small and simply childish
G           A/G              D/A			
But you've created your own ghost
                         F#/Bb             Dsus   D
And the need you have is more than most to hide it

F    G                 F                      G	      C
Oh, Chameleon, you're stealing your way back into my eyes
D/C                   G/D
Beyond a shadow of a doubt
         C/E                      F#/D	
You're a devil, you're a devil in disguise
B                    Em      A           Dsus  D
Do you really change me, or am I going crazy
G           Bm         Em                C     D       G
Chameleon, Chameleon, Chameleon, you're free again my child

G  Bm/F#   Em  G/D                  C           
I remember still those lazy summer days
G/B	Am7                Bm  C/D
We'd kill out hunting danger
G	Bm/F# Em   G/D		G/D	        	
And we were alien to all outsiders
C           G/B               Am7	   E7
We had no desire to talk to strangers

Outro: C - Bb
