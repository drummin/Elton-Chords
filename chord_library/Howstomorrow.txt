Howís Tomorrow
(B-Side "Turn Out the Lights When You Leave")

         G        Em               Am            Am7   
He said "How's tomorrow?" Then he drove back to town

         D          Em            C6                C    
Thinking she might follow, hoping she might stick around

       G           Em        Am           Am7
It was only the thunder that held up the train

             D                 Em               C6          C
But in that first flash of lightning he saw her face in the rain



           A                Dm       G   G7/B     C    
He learned truth in the meaning Of love at first sight

            B7             Em                   F           C
And when he said "How's tomorrow?,he meant the rest of his life


chorus:

                  Bb                 D    
Little moments in time are hard to define

          Gm          Gm/F       Eb   
Frozen forever, locked up in our minds

                  Bb                            D
The reasons we're right there at a point in our lives

                   Gm            Gm/F      Eb 
Isn't ours for the asking, isn't ours to decide

                    Bb           D  D/E  D/F#     Gm  Gm/F Eb
It's not always but often, but when that moment arrives

             Bb  Bb/A   Gm  Gm/F   
When we say "How's tomorrow?"

Eb          F           Bb     
We mean the rest of our lives

She stayed a while
Feeling drawn to that place
Could it be the dark stranger
Or something she sensed as fate
She was always a dreamer
She spent her life on the rails
Working jobs through the heartland
To keep some wind in her sails
But when he stepped from the darkness
Out into the light
And when he said "How's tomorrow?"
She saw the rest of her life

[repeat chorus]


                  Bb                 D    
Little moments in time are hard to define

          Gm          Gm/F       Eb   
Frozen forever, locked up in our minds

                  Bb                            D
The reasons we're right there at a point in our lives

                    Gm           Gm/F      Eb 
Isn't ours for the asking, isn't ours to decide

                    Bb         D    D/E  D/F#     Gm  Gm/F Eb
It's not always but often, but when that moment arrives

When we say "How's tomorrow?"    We mean the rest of our lives
