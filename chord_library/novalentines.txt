Words and Music by: Elton John and Bernie Taupin

Intro: C  C7  Fm/C  

C                   Fm+
No more Valentine's Day
C                   Fm+
No more Christmas cards
                 Am
I've thrown them all away
C/G                F
No more sequined stars
E            Am
No birthday wishes
E        Am    
No more surprises
               F
Who needs them anyway
                  Bb
No reason to get excited

C                   Fm+
Yes I gave you everything
C                   Fm+
I gave you earth and sky
                Am
And everything in between
C/G                      F
That walks or crawls or flies
E            Am
No Easter mornings
E               Am    
It's your cross now
             F
Keep it all for yourself
                  Bb
It's overrated anyhow

Eb                    Gm/D
But keep my Valentine
              Cm           Cm/Bb
I'll keep my bleeding heart
             Ab        
Just let me out of here
                        Gsus4      G     
Before that sentimental music starts
Eb               Gm/D
And your regrets
                  Cm   Cm/Bb
Fall like empty lines
          Ab              Gsus4    G
Like the lies we write on Valentines
