My Strongest Suit
{Words and Music by Elton John & Tim Rice}


    G9                            Em      C                                G  C/G - G
In life one has to face a huge assortment - of nauseating fads and good advice.
         G                    /F#   Em      C                                    D
There's health & fitness, diet & deportment - and other pointless forms of sacrifice.
B/F#                      Em       /D  C                                 | C * D * |
Conversation? Wit? I am a doubter.     Manners? Charm? They're no way to impress.
       G            G/F#            Em     /D  C            D              G
So forget the inner me, observe the outer.     I am what I wear and how I dress.


       | G                  |                 | Em                 |
{Chorus} Overwear,underwear. Anytime,anywhere.  Overwear,underwear. Anytime,anywhere.
       | C                  |                 | G/D |  D  |
         Overwear,underwear. Anytime,anywhere - ooh.  (usually played twice}



           G            C/G   G                  Em
1) Oh-now, I    believe in   loo-king   like  my time on earth is coo-king
2) Staying in    or hit-ting townwards, from the top and working  downwards
3) Now you don't need a re - cital   -   of  the reasons why its   vi-tal

                C           F/C  C                    G
     1) whether pol-ka - dotted stripes   or    e-ven checks.
     2)    I en-sure that every stitch is stitched in time.
     3) that to-night  I simply  have   to  look   my best.

             G          C/G  G              Em 
1) With some glamour guaran-teeing  every   fiber  of   my  being
  2) Whether wig or hat or  turban, whether clad boudoir or urban
3) That from cor-o-net  to  sandal - no one else is worth a candle.

                C               F/C  C               G
     1) is dis-played to  quite re - markable    ef-fect.
     2) Not to strut your stuff out- rageously's  a crime.
     3) That I couldn't   make  more impact  if I'm dressed.

             Bm7                              Em
1) From your cradle  via  trousseau   to your death bed you're on view so
  2) And the few   who are in-vited   to  my  wardrobe   are   delighted
       3) So bring me  out my finest, most au-dacious,   my    divinest.

                C           F/C   C                G/D     D
       1) never compromise    ac-cept   no sub-sti-tute.
     2) as they wander   thru my things to find en route÷
     3) Most re-vealing, most ex-pen-sive  and  to boot.

           Am                                      Em
1) I would rather wear a   bar-rel       than  con-servative      ap-parel
2) That in negligee  or    for-mal        I    am  anything      but normal
3) Most ar-resting, most heart-stopping, most free-flowing, most eye-popping.

                   C                D                 G
1,2 & 3) Whoa-oh, dress has always been my strongest suit.
