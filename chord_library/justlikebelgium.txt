          G                          C
Remember Belgium and the Brussels Museum -
                            D                        | G  -  C/E  -  Am/D |
     where we piled on the front steps like stray cavaliers.
G                                  C
Our code of living meant little to others.
                   D                          | G  -  C/E  -  Am/D |
The few francs we saved bought some cheap souvenirs.


        C                             D                 G         C
Chorus: But the red lights where the catfights make it just like Belgium.
        G                        Em                     F (fñeñdñc) | D (d-c-b-a)
        See us face down on the floor of another cheap barroom.
        C                    D               G          C
        Streetwalkers sweet talk you out of your spare change.
                  G                     D              C                  G
        And your sweet Madame makes it seem just like Belgium, just like Belgium.


             G                         C
Just like a hustler when they look attractive. 
                  D                     | G  -  C/E  -  Am/D |
Oh, it's nothing more than a slap on the back.
G                                         C
The price tag of being just a little bit different -
                        D                          | G  -  C/E  -  Am/D |
     the first rule to learn is to keep your own distance.
 

    {Repeat Chorus}
