Intro: C - G - E/G# - Am - G - F - C - G7 - F C/E Dmdim C
            C                     C                   G
It looked a lot like the same old thing I've seen so many times
         C                C                F             G7
She was aging fast like a bandit Born to a life of crime
      C                C7/Bb                  F/A  Ddim/F#
Meanwhile he held his ground and watched her fall
                   C/G  G7             F (Bass: f e d)  C
Just bouncing her around like a rubber ball

Through her washed up eyes she could see That the ties on her prince 
were gone
He turned the radio off when they played What he once had called their 
song
Well the crystal didn't clink but they drink up more
And when he stayed out late she knew what he stayed out for

          G                E/G#                  Am
Love's so cold when you're growing old and your looks are gone
     Am/G F            D/F#                          G             G7
Love's so cold when your hands don't dance where they once belonged 
(once belonged)
        C                   C7/Bb                   F/A  D/F#
If he's heading down to the red light and the local bar
          C7/G                   G7                 F (bass: f e d) C
Love's so cold when he shoots an arrow through your heart
C               G     E/F#               Am        G   F
e  e   e  d  c  c   b   f  f   f   e  d   d  c   c b   a
La la  la la la la  la  La la  la  la la  la la  Ohh   Oh
           C/G                    G7                F ( bass: f e d )   
C
Love's so cold when he shoots an arrow through your heart


Due to natural causes she became distorted and she tried to leave
But the winning team had an Ace or two up a crooked sleeve
For he knew that her age wouldn't help her get along
And that's what made his hold on her so strong
