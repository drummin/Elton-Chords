You know that I love you   -   but I love to be free.

        Two arms to hold you, one place to be -

             are just some of the things        -      that a woman needs.


I've been short-changed and cheated so many times.
But you're all that I've wanted for all of my life.
I've searched for the reasons, known how I've felt.
But what can I give you when I can't trust myself?

       Bb          /Ab                    Cm
