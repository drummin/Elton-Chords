and the maddess that makes this city hard


i heard a baskettball
somewhere out beyond a chain link fence
inner city prisoners
argue for the right of self defense
but theres a fast break
and every work of art brakes something in my soul
just focus on the cross strokes
and the bouquets that the dancers hold

spanish harlem still sounds good to me
C                       G7

B7                       Em
stading in the shadow of miss liberty
        F#             B
while i walk along the west side
G                   C
down through little italy
F
searching for the city 
D
