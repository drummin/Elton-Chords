A				    Bm
We've moved on six miles from where we were yesterday

    A\C#	       Dm		  Dm  C#m Cm Bm
And yesterday is but a long long ways away

Bm	      A\C#	  D	      B(no 3rd)
So we'll camp out tonight beneath the bright starlight

       A			  G	       D
And forget rotten peaches and the places we've stayed


A			 Bm
I left from the dockland two years ago now

	A\C#		     Dm
Made my way over on the S.S. Marie

	 Bm	    A\C#	D	    B(no 3rd) 
And I've always had trouble wherever I have settled

A		   G		 D
Rotten peaches are all that I see


G		A		 D
Rotten peaches rotting in the sun

G			   A			    D
Seems I've seen that devil fruit since the world begun

A	      E	      Dm	    Bm
Mercy I'm a criminal, Jesus I'm the one

       A       G	       D
Rotten peaches rotting in the sun
(REPEAT)*


A				Bm	
There ain't no green grass in a U.S. state prison

	 A\C#			    Dm		      Dm  C#m Cm Bm
There is no one to hold when you're sick for your wife

    Bm		 A\C#         D			 B(no 3rd)    
And each day out you'll pick, you'll pick rotten peaches

	    A			   G		D
You'll pick rotten peaches for the rest of your life


	A		  Bm	
Oh I've had me my fill of cocaine and pills

      D			      Dm
For I lie in the light of the Lord

       Bm	   A\C#	         D		 B(no 3rd)
And my home is ten thousand, ten thousand miles away

      A		    G	      D
And I guess I won't see it no more


G		A		 D
Rotten peaches rotting in the sun

G			   A			    D
Seems I've seen that devil fruit since the world begun

A	      E	      Dm	    Bm
Mercy I'm a criminal, Jesus I'm the one

       A       G	       D
Rotten peaches rotting in the sun


G		A		 D
Rotten peaches rotting in the sun

G			   A			    D
Seems I've seen that devil fruit since the world begun

A	      E	      Dm	    		   Bm
Mercy I'm a criminal, Jesus I'm the, Jesus I'm the one

       A       G	       D
Rotten peaches rotting in the sun

       A       G	       D
Rotten peaches rotting in the sun

       A       G	       D
Rotten peaches rotting in the sun

La la la la la la, la la la la la la,

La la la la la la.

La la la la la la, la la la la la la la la.
