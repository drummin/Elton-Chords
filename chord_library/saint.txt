You don't pass your time in limbo or hang out with the crowd.

Sitting on the stoop like a little girl who took the wrong road into town.
Eb                              Ab/Eb
But you got that short cut way about you.
Bb/Eb                    Eb
No one's gonna stare you down.
    Eb        Db          Eb/G    Ab  
You cook much better on a lower flame.
              Fm              Eb/G     Bb
You burn much better when the sun goes down.

And heaven can wait, but you ought to be a saint

I got your very best intentions helping me along.
                      Eb      Eb/Db                          Csus
And if I ever fail to mention   -   you were an overnight sensation.

Well take it from me, my baby's a  saint.

         My baby's a   saint


Eb                         Ab/Eb                   Eb
I believe you were a new arrival on the fast train passing through.
        Eb             Db          Eb/G   Ab             Fm     Eb/G    Bb    /F
And you traded in your luck for survival   -  to sweeten up the witch's brew.
Eb                              Ab/Eb   Bb/Eb                           Eb
You had a better way of working magic.         A little mystery in your eyes.
  Eb               Db         Eb/G       Ab  
Instead of rolling over you remained the same.

You took the whole world by surprise
