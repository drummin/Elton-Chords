Just like an old friend - putting me on my feet again.
Bm        E        A    Dmaj7  G          A
Giving me back my pride then - letting me go.
              G   D       Bm         A      G     D
Just like an old friend - putting me in my place again.

Giving me back my hope then - letting me know that he's an old     friend.



A7  {Bass throughout: /A  /C#  /D-/D#-/E  repeated}
We're having a man-to-man.  Don't want to get sentimental.

But both of us understand we'll never have to say Goodbye - just See You Later.
