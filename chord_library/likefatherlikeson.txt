Like father, like son.  Like father, like son.  Like father, like son.


Bb               Eb/Bb    Bb  Bb                       Eb
Don't come on so cocksure boy - you can't escape your genes.
Bb                                                   Eb
No point in feeling pure boy.  Your background intervenes.
Eb                                Bb/D                  Eb
Listen good and listen straight.  You're not the master of your fate.
F#                    B/F# F#     Ab
To this you must be recon-ciled:     You'll always be your father's child.
Bb                      Eb                            C7/E
At times acclaimed, at times reviled - you'll wind up doing just what I've done.
   | Bb/F   | F7/A   | Abmaj7/Bb | Eb/Bb   | Bb/F   | F7/A   | Abmaj7/Bb | Eb/Bb |
Like father,      like son.             Like father,      like son.


Bb       Eb       Bb    Bb            Eb
Don't assume your vices - get handed down the line.
Bb               Eb      Bb                    Eb
That a parent's blood suffices to condemn the child's design.
Eb                             Bb/D                 Eb
I've done wrong, I can't deny.      But at least I know that I -
| F#  *        B/F#   * | F# *   B/F# F# | Ab
     shouldn't blame that on my stock,        this may come as quite a shock:
    Bb              Eb                    C7/E
But I'm no chip off any block, I wouldn't wish those words on anyone.
   | Bb/F   | F7/A   | Abmaj7/Bb | Eb/Bb   | Bb/F   | F7/A   | Abmaj7/Bb | Eb/Bb |
Like father,      like son.             Like father,      like son.


Gm7(add4)                          F/A 
Son, you're nervous, take my hand.     All is settled, all is planned.
Dm7(add4)                                      Gm7(add4)       Gm
You've got the world at your command - I don't think you understand.
Just have the slave if you must, and be done with her.
Don't ever speak of her like that again.
Gm                     F2/A
I appreciate too well,       the squalor at which you excel.
Dm(sus4)                  | Gm     *    F/G  *  | *     *   Gm  *  |
It isn't very hard to tell, evil's a distinctive smell.
| Ab/Bb                    | *   *   Eb/Bb * | Bb                           | Bb 
>From this day on I choose my own way.    If I choose to be with Aida, then I will be.
                                 | Bb 
And no one, not you, not even the gods can stop me.


Bb             Eb      Bb       Bb                  Eb
He's lost all sense of reason.       And why?  Some foreign slut.
Bb       Eb      Bb      Bb                Eb
Not only is that treason - some doors are slamming shut.
Eb                                | Bb/D    Eb Bb/D  * | Bb/D
Just like me, he's found that flesh  -  can ex-cite but  will it mesh?
F#                            | Ab    *   * Db/Ab | Ab  *  Db/Ab  Ab |
Once we rid him of this blight, once the har-lot's  out of sight -
Bb                   Eb                     C7/E
Then I think he will see the light he won't walk back to daddy, heíll run.
   | Bb/F   | F7/A   | Abmaj7/Bb | Eb/Bb   | Bb/F   | F7/A   | Abmaj7/Bb | Eb/Bb |
Like father,      like son.             Like father,      like son.
