Intro: | F   Bb/D | F  Bb/D | F  Bb/D | F  Bb/D |

F             Bb/D   F                 F/Eb           Bb/D
Cast a pebble on the water.  Watch the ripples gently spreading.
     F               Am                 Gm7           Bb(add C)
Tiny daughter of the Camargue - we were meant to be together.
        F                         F/Eb             Bb/D
We were made for one another in a time it takes to grow up,
                Gm7               Am7        Bb             F     Bb/F
if only we were old enough - then they might leave us both alone.


F          Bb    C          | F    Fsus | F  Fsus  F |
So take my hand  -  in your   hand.   
Bb       C          | F       Fsus | F  Fsus  F |     
Say it's great to be alive.
         Bb       C            F      Am/E     Dm
No one's going to find us - no matter how they try.
         Eb       Bb/D          Gm7          Fmaj7/A     Bb        F   Bb/F
No one's going to find us. It's wonderful, so wild     beneath the sky.


{Repeat Intro}



Sleeping in the open, see the shadows softly moving.
Take a train towards the southlands.  Our time was never better.
We shall pass the sights of splendor on the door of a new life.
It had to happen soon I guess whether it is wrong or it is right.


{Repeat Chorus}


We learned to be so graceful watching wild horses running.
And from those agile angels we knew the tide was turning.
For we watched as on the skyway - the herons circled slowly.
While we mere mortals watched them fly our sleepless eyes grew heavy.


{Repeat Chorus Twice}

Coda:  | Bb/F | F  Bb/F | F |
