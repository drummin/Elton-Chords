Em   	       D	        G
Why's it never light on my lawn

	    Am 		   G		Bm C           D
Why does it rain and never say good-day to the new-born

C6 D   Em              D	     G
On the big screen they showed us the sun

	   Am 	     G		 Bm C D
But not as bright in life as the real one

	   Am        G		 Bm C D
It's never quite the same as the real one


B	    F#\B
And tell me grey seal

	    B7sus
How does it feel

	 E\B
To be so wise

B	       F#\B
To see through eyes

	  B7sus	     E\B
That only see what's real

B F# A  E    B
Tell me grey seal

	Em	        D	       G
I never learned why meteors were formed

	Am	 G		      Bm   C   D
I only farmed in schools that were so worn and torn

      Em	       D      G
If anyone can cry then so can I

       Am             G    Bm   C   D
I read books and draw life from the eye

	Am       G	Bm   C   D
All my life is drawings from the eye

(CHORUS)

	     G			   D	   G
Your mission bells were wrought by ancient men

	       Am		 G
The roots were formed by twisted roots

		Bm C	D
Your roots were twisted then

	 G		 D	    G
I was re-born before all life could die

	    Am                   G        Bm C D
The Phoenix bird will leave this world to fly___

	  Am            G	 Bm C   D
If the Phoenix bird can fly then so can I

(CHORUS)

Dsus  D7
(REPEAT, FADE)
