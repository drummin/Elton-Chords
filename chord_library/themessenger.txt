Intro: G#m (2 measures) D#m (2 measures) E F# (1 measure each)


B                  E/B     C#                    F#
Everything is settled, immovable and calm

A                      G#                      C#m                E+C#
Nothing that has plagued our lives can ever do us harm

B                              E              C#                        
F#
Then the voices railed against us, then the path was steep

A                             G# G#7   C#m                C#nat    F#
Now the sounds are softer,      now the road is end-----ed

F#                      B
In your arms, I'll sleep



B b  c# d#      b      G#m                           A
Turn a--way from madness, burn the inner light

                       B                                      E         
D/E
Pray for me as cheerfully as I slip into the night

                      A      Am                   G#m
Death is just a visitor watching for a while

C#m          A              B                 A/E   E 
Sullen and predictable, love is versatile

C#m (2 measures) G#m (2 measures)  A  B (1 measure each)


E                  A/E       F#                   B
Everything is peaceful, and falling into place

D              C#        C#7     F#m                 B+A
I no longer feel the wounds suffered in the chase

E                                 A          F#                      B
Then we were at turns divided, then by turns oppressed

D                     C#  C#7   F#m              F#   B
Now the pain is o---ver,    now we lie toge---ther

B                 E
Gratefully at rest


E e  d#   c#   b   G#m                        A
Put   a---side the notion that the end is near

                     B                                      E      D/E
Stay with me eternally, the terrors disappear

                       A            Am                   G#m
Death is just a messenger     in a poor disguise

C#m                 A                     B                   A/E   E  
Fooling no one, lost for words, love is in your eyes


D/E                      A                  Am               G#m
Now we know as we are known, unimagined things

C#m                   A             B                      A/E      E
Death is just the messenger, love the truth it brings
  

Fine: C#m (2 measures) G#m (2 measures) A  B (1 measure each) E (1 
measure ritard and hold)
