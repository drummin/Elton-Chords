I Can't Steer my Heart Clear of You
Words and Music by: Elton John and Bernie Taupin

INTRO: Ab - F#/Eb

Ab                  F#/Eb                       
Take me for granted, I think that I could stand it
C#                    
After all these rough seas
       Ab       
Left me reckless and abandoned
F#                        Bbm
Say the spirits willing, chance a new beginning
B
Break down the cold front
       A         
Give me peace and understanding
      
     C#m             Abm
And you wait, and you wonder
          A                                  E
Will she still beat the drum and bring the thunder
           B                      C#m
Will she still be the star to see me through
          A             A/G             F    G     
'Cause I can't steer my heart clear of you

      E                    G
No I can't steer my heart clear of you
C                     Em/B  Am     
It's the way it's been,      ever since you sailed
                     B
Out of a storm and into view
               Em             G/D               C    
And should I drift away, the compass holds the clue
                 Ab
You control the weather
       Bb                             Csus                 
And I can't steer my heart clear of you

Ab                  F#/Eb
Make me your penance, show me your innocence
C#                    
Everything is history
          Ab                   
From the aching to the pleasure
F#                        Bbm
We enjoy the torture, the slow pain that it taught us
B
Everything gets twisted
        A         
Let me burn or bring me water
