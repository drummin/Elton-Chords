Words and Music by: Elton John and Bernie Taupin

Intro: Cm - D - Gm - Cm/A  Cm - D - G

G	               
Pull my coat around me
Am
Feel the cold wind haunt me
C                           G
Streets are empty just like me
    A       
The murmur of an echo
A
Seems to come from every window
     C                            D
Is loneliness the same as being free

Bm                        Em
I guess I must have been dreaming
              C              Am
To think that I believed in you at all
Bm                Em             
Now I just can't fight it
        C               Am            D
As the shadow of the night begins to fall

Eb            Ab       Bb   Eb
Love's got a lot to answer for
       Eb         Ab             Bb       Eb
Oh I just can't sleep with this feeling anymore
         Eb         Ab   Bb  G/B   Cm
Let the cold night air cool the heat
    Eb/G       Ab      Bb
Of two hearts gone to war
     Cm             D  Gm      Cm/A
For no matter who wins, in the end
Ab           Eb/G     Bb    Eb
Love's got a lot to answer for

G	     
All I need is darkness
Am
The best of all protection
C                           G
Freedom's like the stars in the sky
    A 
Alone and cold and burning
A
Each one keeps it's distance
     C                         D
If only we were stars, you and I
