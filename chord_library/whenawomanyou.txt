When A Woman Doesn't Want You
by: Elton John and Bernie Taupin

Intro: G - Em/C - Bm7 - C - C/D

G          Em/C
She may be lost
                    Bm7
She may be out of bounds
C                      G/B                   Em
All her tenderness and charms could be something
   G/D     C       G/B   Am7   Am7/D
A man like me has never found
G          Em/C
But in her woman's way
                    Bm7
She's still a little girl
C                    G/B      Em                 G/D       
The things that she wants, the things that she needs
C        G/B           C   D
Oh well the choice is hers

chorus:
G                        Bm
`Cause you can't take a woman
C                     G
When she doesn't want you
C                  G/B
And you can't be a man
D          D  D/E   D/F#
If you're blind to reason
G               Bm7
Man might be strong
C                 A7/C#            
But true love is stronger
           C         G/B
You gotta play it straight
        Am     D      Eb
When a woman doesn't want you

G          Em/C
Her voice invites
                    Bm7
Her eyes say more than words
C                  G/B
But her needs and complications
     Em   G/D       C        G/B           Am   D
Can tear away the memory of last night's girl
G             Em/C
And if you're weak
                    Bm7
Yeah we're all weak sometime
C                    G/B
The best things can wait
Em                 G/D       
The best times they come
C        G/B         C   C/D
Oh when strength is kind

G  G/F      
                   C/E
And if you can't read her
G              G/F
Leave her alone
                   C/E
And if you don't know by now
     Am          
She's not someone's prize
A                        D
And you can't take her home
