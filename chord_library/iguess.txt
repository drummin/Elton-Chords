I Guess That's Why They Call It The Blues 
by: Elton John, Bernie Taupin and Davey Johnstone

intro: C - Em - F  

G        
Don't wish it away
Em                     F          C-F-C-F-C-F 
Don't look at it like it's forever
C                 G
Between you and me
                  Bm        F                       C-F-C-F-C-F
I could honestly say that things can only get better
     C         G    B7                    Em  G/D  C
And while I'm away bust out the demons inside 
                 C                      G
And it won't be long before you and me run
                       Am    F       C  G/B  G7
To the place in our hearts where we hide

Chorus :
        C                    G           F
And I guess that's why they call it the blues
             C               G             F
Time on my hands could be time spent with you
C                   G   
Laughing like children
                Am
Living like lovers
C               F                 D/F#
Rolling like thunder, under the covers
	F                       G                   
And I guess that's why they call it the blues

2nd verse:
G
Just stare into space
Em				  F  C-F-C-F-C-F
Picture my face in your hands
C			G
Live for each second  
		  Bm	   F				   C-F-C-F-C-F
Without hesitation, never forget I'm your man
C	      G	B7				Em  G/D 
Wait on me girl, cry in the night if it helps
		  C			    G
But more than ever I simply love you
           Am    F         C  G/B  G7
More than I love life itself
