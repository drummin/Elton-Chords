Db  Ab  Gb  (Gb\Ab)*  Db  Ab  Gb  (Gb\Ab)*  

Db
It's a human sign

Gb	       Ebm   Ab
When things go wrong

		       Db      Gb
When the scent of her lingers

		    Ebm  Ab
And temptation's strong


	  Bbm     Gb
Into the boundary

		 Ebm  Ab
Of each married man

		    Bbm
Sweet deceit comes calling

	       Ab
And negativity lands


	  Db	Gb
Cold cold heart

	      Ebm  Ab	
Hard done by you

		  Db	     Gb
Some things look better baby

		Ab
Just passing through


	    Db
And it's no sacrifice

	       Ebm
Just a simple word

		 Ebm
It's two hearts living

Gb	Gb\Ab    Db
In two separate worlds

	    Db
But it's no sacrifice

   Ebm
No sacrifice

	Ebm   Gb  Gb\Ab Db  Ab  Gb  (Gb\Ab)*  
It's no sacrifice at   all


Db		 Gb
Mutual misunderstanding

	  Ebm  Ab
After the fact

	      Db	    Gb
Sensitivity builds a prison

	     Ebm  Ab
In the final act


	  Bbm	  Gb
We lose direction

	   Ebm    Ab
No stone unturned

	     Bbm     Gb
No tears to damn you

	       Ab
When jealousy burns

(CHORUS)

Db  Ab  Gb  (Gb\Ab)*  Db  Ab  Gb  (Gb\Ab)*  

(CHORUS)

Db  Ab Gb        (Gb\Ab)*   
         It's no sacrifice at all
(REPEAT, FADE)

"Sacrifice" was recorded by Elton in the key of Db.  Every single copy of its sheet music I have seen
is in the key of C.  Here, it has been transposed back to its original (and better-sounding) key, perhaps
the first time it has ever been done.  If you can show me a copy of "Sacrifice" in sheet music in the key
of Db, I would love to see it.
