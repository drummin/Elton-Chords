     Gm         Eb          F
your accountant called this morning
Cm        Bb6         Ab     Gm/D
there was spring time in his heart
D7 Gm           Eb F       Cm     Bb6        Eb/Db  Ab/Eb  C/E Em
he couldnt wait to tell me how he pulled our lives apart
        Eb/G   Fb        Bb6                  G7/B   Cm
and the letter from your lawyer lies unopened on the tray
      Eb/G          Bb6                       Eb
i may get around to reading it latter to day

walking round the lonely rooms
i see everything the same
but suddenly it matters what was purchased in my name
whether this or that is paid
belongs to me or you
can seven years together be divided by two

Eb                        Abmaj7
it says something for the legal boys
    Fm6/Ab
but nothing much for us
                G7  Cm/G                     G
that all we had together is so quickly ended thus
                    Abmaj7
the legal boys have won again
                   Fm6/Ab
and you and i have lost
                         G7 Cm/G
they cant tell us how it happened
                           Ab
but theyll let us know the cost
                           Bb6  Eb
but theyll let us know the cost oh yeah


theres alot id like to tell you
but i cant get past their gaurds
i do not speak their language
and they hold all the cards
i would rather call you darling that defendant in the case
but lovers left her long ago and clients took their place

Eb                        Abmaj7
it says something for the legal boys
    Fm6/Ab
but nothing much for us
                G7  Cm/G                     G
that all we had together is so quickly ended thus

(interlude: Abmaj7  Fm6/Ab  G7  Cm/G  G)

                    Abmaj7
the legal boys have won again
                   Fm6/Ab
and you and i have lost
                         G7 Cm/G
they cant tell us how it happened
                           Ab
but theyll let us know the cost
                           Bb6  Eb
but theyll let us know the cost oh yeah
