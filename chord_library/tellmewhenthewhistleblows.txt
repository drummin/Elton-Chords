Intro: | Dm / / / | / / / / | / / / / | / / / / |


          Dm                G/A - Dm
There's a dusty old gutter           he's lying in now.
Dm
Umm, he's blind and he's old.
              G7           A              Dm
And there's a bottle that rolls down the road.
Dm           G/D - Dm
Me I'm young          and I'm so wild - and I still feel the need 
             G              A         Bm
     of your apron strings once in a while.
             A                    E           G7          Dm
For there's taxicabs hooting, but I can't be footloose forever.
    A                              E
My suitcase it's a cheap one.  My darling she's a dear one.
    G7                        C
My head's feeling light as a feather.



CHORUS:  G7                       Dm
Take my ears and tell me when the whistle blows.
        G7                      Dm
Wake me up and tell me when the whistle blows.
Dm             A                 Bm                G7
Long lost and lonely boy you're just a black sheep going home.
   Dm                A         G7     D             A        G7
I want to feel your wheels of steel - underneath my itching heels.
         D       G7              A7       Bm /D /F# /D   /B /D /F# /D  {Intro}
Take my money - tell me when the whistle blows.



Dm                   G/A - Dm
Part of me asked the young man for the time
Dm                            G7        A              Dm
With a cool vacant stare - of undue concern he said, "Nine".
Dm                     G/D - Dm
It's not so bad but I really do love the land.
Dm                                                 G    A            Bm
And rather all this than those diamante lovers in Hyde Park holding hands.
         A                       E         G7            Dm
Blowing heat through my fingers trying to kill off this cold.
          A                            E
Will the street kids remember?  Can I still shoot a fast cue?
          G7                        C
Has this country kid still got his soul?
