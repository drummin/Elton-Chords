I was justified when  I  was five.    Raising cane, I spit in your eye.
 F        C/F                C
Times are changing, now the poor get fat.
        C/G            G                  D7         G    {C/G - C/G - G}
But the fever's gonna catch you when the bitch gets back.

Eat meat on Friday that's alright.  Even like steak on a Saturday night.
       F        C/F          C
I can bitch the best at your social do's.
      C/G          G               D7      G    {C/G - C/G - G}
I get high in the evening sniffing pots of glue.




CHORUS:
      D7
I'm a bitch.  I'm a bitch.  Oh, the bitch is back.
G                      C
Stone cold sober as a matter of fact.
      D7
I can bitch.  I can bitch.  `Cause I'm better than you.
          F                    D7                      G  {Repeat Intro}
It's the way that I move, the things that I do - oh-oh-oh.



  
  C/G   G      C/G      G       C/G     G        D7       G      
I entertain by picking brains.  Sell my soul by dropping names.
  F           C/F      C
I don't like those, my God, what's that?
         C/G           G               D7          G    {C/G - C/G - G}
Oh, it's full of nasty habits when the bitch gets back.



{Repeat Chorus}

CODA:   Bitch.  Bitch.       The bitch is  back.
