Intro: Dmaj7 / / /     Bm7 / / /     E / / /     F#m / / /  {twice}


            D                 E                  F#m
Whenever I hear good-bye - (Reminds me, baby, of you.)
         D             Bm7       E                F#m
I break down and cry.       The next time I'll be true, yeah
           D               E                  F#m
Fever for lost romance - reminds me, baby, of you.
          D            Bm7       E                F#m
I took a crazy chance.     (The next time I'll be true. I'll be true.)



BRIDGE:
Dmaj7            Bm7             E                 F#m
Footsteps on the dance floor - remind me, baby, of you.
Dmaj7           Bm7     E                F#m
Teardrops in my eyes - next time I'll be true, yeah.
Dmaj7           Bm7              E             F#m
Whispers in the back room - she cries on every tune.  Every tune.



CHORUS: F#m         C#m          F#m7        Bm                E7
And the music don't feel like it did when I felt it with you.
        F#m          C#m       F#m7          Bm              E  {intro}
Nothing that I do or feel ever feels like I felt it with you.



          D                 E                  F#m
When I'm dancing round - (Reminds me, baby, of you.)
         D            Bm7     E                 F#m
I won't let you down.     The next time I'll be true.  I'll be true.
