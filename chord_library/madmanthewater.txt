I can see very well, there's a boat on the reef with a broken back

          F      G    Am   G  C\G  D  Am  G  C\G  D
And I can see it very well

          Am         G            F                  
There's a joke and I know it very well 

            C\E                   D\F#            
It's one of those that I told you long ago, 

        Am7        G      Am            G  C\G  D  Am  G  C\G  D
Take my word I'm a madman don't you know

       Am         G                F
Once a fool had a good part in the play

        C\E                 D\F#
If it's so would I still be here today?

               F          G             Am
It's quite the cuter in a funny sort of way


                F           G            Am
They think it's very funny, everything I say


C             G/B     Esus E
Get a load of him he's so insane 

                Am   C  Dm   F     G    Am
Better get your coat dear it looks like rain



C          Dm         Am7\F    G      Am 
We'll come again next thursday afternoon 

C          Dm           Am7     G      Am  G  
The inlaws hope they'll see you very soon, 

F                                        E    
But is it in your conscience that you're after

Am                     C       F     G   Am
Another glimpse of the madman across the water

Am  G  C\G  D  (Repeat, ad lib)

    F                   G                Am     G
The ground's a long way down, but I need more

F                                 E
Is the nightmare black or are the windows painted

               Am    C    Dm
Will they come again next week?

       F    G      A
Can my mind really take it?
