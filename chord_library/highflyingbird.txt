Ab                                          Db
You wore a little cross of gold around your neck
Ab                              Eb
I saw it as you flew between my reason
       Bb7                     Bbm7     Db
Like a raven in the night time when you left
         Ab                                Db     Ab
I wear a chain upon my wrist that bears no name
Ab                     Eb
You touched it and you wore it
        Bbm                            Db
And you kept it in your pillow all the same


Db             Ab                  Bbm    Db
My high-flying bird has flown from out my arms
                        Bbm
I thought myself her keeper
                        Eb
She thought I meant her harm
                      Ab
She thought I was the archer
  Db          Ab Db
A weather man of words
                  Gb            Db
But I could never shoot down
        Ab   Bbm7               Ab
My high-flying bird


repeat intro

    Ab                                    Db
The white walls of your dressing room are stained in scarlet red
    Ab                              Eb
You bled upon the cold stone like a young man
Bb7            Bbm7     Db
In the foreign field of death
Ab                          Db
Wouldn't it be wonderful is all I heard you say
          Ab                                            Eb        Bbm
You never closed your eyes at night and learned to love daylight
Bbm 
Instead you moved away
