	    G
I'm back on dry land once again

     Gmaj7
Opportunity awaits me like a rat in the drain

Dm		  G7			  C
We're all hunting honey with money to burn

       Cm			  G\B		           Am  D
Just a short time to show you the tricks that we've learned


       G
If the boys all behave themselves here

	     Gmaj7
Well there's pretty young ladies and beer in the rear

Dm		 G7			   C
You won't need a gutter to sleep in tonight

       Cm			 G\B		Am  D
Oh the prices I charge here will see you alright


       G
So she lays down beside me again

   Gmaj7
My sweet painted lady, the one with no name

Dm		       G7	     C
Many have used her and many still do

	  C			   G\B		  Am  D
There's a place in the world for a woman like you


   G		  F#
Oh sweet painted lady

F			   E7
Seems it's always been the same

Am7		 D
Getting paid for being laid

G			     Am7
Guess that's the name of the game

  G		  F#
Oh sweet painted lady

F			   E7
Seems it's always been the same

Am7		 D
Getting paid for being laid

G			     Am7 D
Guess that's the name of the game

 G  D7
Oh!


		     G
Forget us we'll have gone very soon

	Gmaj7
Just forget we ever slept in your rooms

    Dm				 G7	         C
And we'll leave the smell of the sea in your beds

      Cm		    G\B		   Am  D
Where love's just a job and nothing is said


       G
So she lays down beside me again

   Gmaj7
My sweet painted lady, the one with no name

Dm		       G7	     C
Many have used her and many still do

	  C			   G\B		  Am  D
There's a place in the world for a woman like you
