C		        Cm		    F      F7
If anyone should see me making it down the highway

C			     G    Cm\G
Breaking all the laws of the land

      C		      Cm
Well don't you try to stop me

	   F      F7
I'm going her way

    C		       F	Cm\G	 C
And that's the way I'm sure she had it planned


     C			        F    F7
Well that's my Rock-and-roll Madonna

      C				G   Cm\G
She's always been a lady of the road

     C	
Well everybody wants her

    F           F7
But no one ever gets her

	 C		F    Cm\G    C
Well the freeway is the only way she knows


	C			       F          F7
Well if she would only slow down for a short time

    C				    G     Cm\G
I'd get to know her just before she leaves

	  C				F	       F7
But she's got some fascination for that two wheel combination

      C			  F	 Cm\G     C
And I swear it's going to be the death of me

(CHORUS)

         C\G
Rock on, Babe!

			F    F7
Let's get a little bit lower,

C			   G  Cm\G
Oh!  It's getting all right

C
Sing it, baby!

F			 F7
Yeah, that's pretty good.

C					F  Cm\G  C
Now is everybody gonna rock on with me?


One more time!
