G                 Bm/F#   Em                  G/D
Have you seen the North?      That cold grey place.
C                        G/B  Em  C   D  / Dsus  C/D
Don't want its shadow anymore on  my face.
G                   Bm/F#    Em          G/D     C
A man grows bitter.              We're a bitter race.
                        Dsus  D   C/D      G  {replay intro}
Some of us never get to see a bet  -  ter place.



G               Bm/F#  Em                    G/D
In the Northern Skies  -  there was a steel cloud.
C                     G/B                 Em  C   D  /  Dsus  C/D
It used to follow me around - but I don't see it now.
G                     Bm/F#  Em        G/D         C
There's a farm in the rain,      and a little farmhouse.
                              Dsus  D  C/D  Gm7/Bb
There were a young man's eyes    -  looking south.



Gm7/Bb           A+     A7   Dm
The North was my mother.         But I no longer need her.
Gm7/Bb                        A+   A7   Dm
You trade your roots and your dust          for a face in the river.
F/C                    Bb          A+      A7        Dm
And a driven rain that washes you     to a different shore.
          G/B         C          Eb          Bb/D       F/C     C
There's a North in us all but my North can't hold me anymore.
