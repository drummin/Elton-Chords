F  Dm  Bb7+  F\C  F  Dm  Bb7+  F\C

F		  C\Dm Dm
Dust settles on a thin cloud

Bb          		  F	   C7
Sends a fog drifting to a worn out crowd

Bb		      Bb7        C
I've had my face in a mirror for twenty four hours

			   C\E F
Staring at a line of white pow-der


F		    C    Dm
High-priced madness pays the tab

     Bb					   F	   C7
I've scraped too much of nothing from your plastic bag

Bb              	 Bb7	     C
I'm a catatonic son of a bitch who's had

	C		  C\E F   
A touch too much of white pow-der


Bb		  F       F  C\F
And she's a habit I can't handle

Bb	     F       F  C\F
For a reason I can't say

Bb		   F          F C\F
I'm in love with a wild white lady

Bb			C
She's as sweet as the stories say

      Dm 	   F\C
White powder white lady

Bb
You're one and the same

F\A		Bb7
Come on down to my house won't you

    Bb       C   F     Dm  Bb7+ C
And hit this boy again


F		 Dm
Shock waves to a tired brain

Bb			     F    C7
Sends that hungry lady to my door again

Bb			  Bb7			C
She's my shelter from the storm when I feel the rain

C		   C\E F
Entertaining white pow-der


F			  Dm
I feel I'm dry-docked and tongue-tied

Bb				 F       C7
Heaven sends a stretcher for the kids to ride

Bb	       Bb7			   C
I might just escape while the others might die

C		    	  C\E F
Riding on a high of white pow-der

(CHORUS)

(INSTRUMENTAL)

(CHORUS)

      F             Dm  
White powder, white lady,

Bb	 C    F
Hit this boy again
(REPEAT, FADE)
