CLAW HAMMER - ELTON JOHN

INTRO
Dm - G A

VERSE
       Dm
You're holding back
You're hard to read
       Gm
Your a 21st century kind
       C
You're lighting fast
Dm
Built for speed
  Bb           F      C
A tight-lipped modern mind
   Dm
An architect
Of grand romance
         Gm
You're a mystery of disguise
       C                Dm
You're holed up in your house
     Bb      F       C
Just waiting for the fire
       Gm
You're buttoned down
All sown up
You're an ontological soul
Eb
Cold hard truth
Only proof
     D7sus      D7
What we already know

CHORUS
                    G
You're gonna need a claw hammer
C
Oh my Lord
   G/B     Am
To bust on through
    D               G   C/G G
And break down your walls
E7   E7/G#  Am
Loosen your lips
Cm/Eb        G/D
Slacken that jaw
                  Dm/F C/E
It's gonna take a claw hammer
      G C/G G
Oh my Lord

INSTRUMENTAL
Dm - G A

VERSE
Dm
Look at us fools
Being used
      Gm
We're totally dumb, surprised
C                  Dm
Waiting for you to share with us
    Bb   F          C
The myth behind the lies
Dm
Come on out
Throw us a bone
   Gm
We want to know your intentions
C
Are you fake
    Dm
For goodness sake
       Bb     F    C
Or the Mother of Invention
G
You're buttoned down
All sown up
          Gm
You're an ontological soul
Eb
Cold hard truth
Only proof
     D7sus      D7
What we already know

CHORUS
                    G
You're gonna need a claw hammer
C
Oh my Lord
   G/B     Am
To bust on through

And break down your walls

Loosen your lips
Cm/Eb        G/D
Slacken that jaw
                  Dm/F C/E
It's gonna take a claw hammer
      G C/G G
Oh my Lord
