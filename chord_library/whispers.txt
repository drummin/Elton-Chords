Music By: Elton John
Words By; Bernie Taupin


intro: Cm  Fm7 |  Bsus4  Bb|  Ab/Eb  Eb |  Cm  Fm7|
Bbsus4  Bb  |  Fmsus4  C |  B  |  B  |

Eb         Cm         Ab/Db
Look at me twice with wildcat eyes
Db                      Ab          Eb
Promise me everything except a blue night
             Cm    Ab/Db        Db
Shudder like ice in cut crystal glass
                    Cm7
Melt in embraces of crazy eyed past
    B        Db                  Eb
And whisper, whisper, whispering whispers

Eb              Cm       Ab/Db
Tantamount to a lie with lingering breath
Db                          Ab        Eb
Walking fingers run, hungry scratches left
                Cm          Ab/Db Db
Dull chimes ringing like an empty voice
                                     Cm7
A distant smile framed, her lips are soft and moist
     B         Db                       Eb
With whispers, whispers, whispering whispers


Cm                           Ab
And whisper in a rhythm your lies
     Bbsus4       Bb
Keep comfort for others
        Ab/Eb    Eb
Hurt me with the night
Cm                                   Ab
Whisper like cold winds close to the bone
     Bbsus4        Bb         Fm  C
Save heaven for lovers, leave me alone
          B         Db                       Eb
With your whispers, whispers, whispering whispers
