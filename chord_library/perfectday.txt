     Album : Blender (by Collective Soul)



C                 Em                 Am                 F
There she stumbles - falling to her knees.  I think she tripped on reality.
C                Em            Am               F                         F-C
I have witnessed - tragic comedies.  That's the world in which she leads.



{Bridge & Chorus 1}
Dm                      G                  Dm               G
I would walk a million miles, to give her  -  all that she needs.
    Dm                       G            Dm              F
But she would walk a million more to do   -   what she believes.
C(add A)              G4(add A)  G                   F
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh.     Ooh -  ooh.   She'll have a perfect day.
C(add A)              G4(add A)  G                   F
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh.     Ooh -  ooh.   She'll have a perfect day.



C                  Em             Am
Troubles blooming, innocence now fades.
            F                             Bb-F
Still she's dry through all the rain.
C                    Em                  Am
There's no purpose   -   she has yet to crave.
               F                    F-C
She's like the big dog on parade.



{Bridge & Chorus 2}
Dm                      G                  Dm               G
I would walk a million miles, to give her  -  all that she needs.
    Dm                       G           Dm              F
But she would walk a million more to do  -  well as she pleased.
C(add A)              G4(add A)  G                   F
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh.     Ooh -  ooh.   She'll have a perfect day.
C(add A)              G4(add A)  G                   F
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh.     Ooh -  ooh.   She'll have a perfect day.



Bb                            F                         C
I can't figure this one out.  I've no words here to explain.
Bb                              F                                     C
She'll just sugar kiss me off.  She'll just have another perfect day.
