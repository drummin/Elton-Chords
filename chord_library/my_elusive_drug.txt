Verse 1:F                              Fm            Eb
             I'm not the same as I used to be.
                        
             All the things you've heard,
                      Bb
             Seem hard to believe.
             Gm                          Am     Dm                          Dm/C
             Haven't always been good, never really been bad.
             Bb                             F/A              Gm7        Gm7/A#    C  
             Most times, I've been happy.  Yet, sometimes I've been sad.


Verse 2:F                                    Fm
             Sure, I've made mistakes.  
                                    Eb
             Haven't we all?
                                                          Bb                  Gm     
             I been loose as a cannon and dumb as a wall.
                                             A      Dm                             Dm/C
             Haven't always been sober, and counted my ducks.
             Bb                F/A           Gm7     Gm7/A#  C
             And, if I look back now, I had my share of luck,


Chorus:              Dm               Dm/C       Bb
             But, the change didn't come overnight.
                            F                Faug/C#     Dm  Dm/C
             I've been searching for you all my life.
                       Bb                           Bm7/G#
             All the habits that I couldn't handle.
                               G      Bb    C
             I swept them under the rug.
                     C#                 Fm/C        C#/A#
             In exchange for the sweetest addiction, 
             C                              F
             You:  my elusive drug.


Verse 3 :F                           Fm
             I'm gonna stay now.  
                                        Eb
             I really like it here.
                                               Bb
             I may paint your picture, and I might grow a beard.
             Gm                               A       Dm                           Dm/C
             There were times I was crazy, couldn't handle my life.
             Bb                     F/A     Gm7  Gm7/A#  C     A/C#
             Don't think you'll like me, not at any old price.


-Repeat Chorus-


Bridge: C#                           Eb
            Now, I've taken the pills.  
                    Ab                Cm/G           Fm
            I got burnt out and chilled by the cold,
            C#                                    Fm/C
            But I've got no regrets, and that being said,
                              Bb                                    Eb  Em  F
            You know, cheap thrills can get pretty old.
            Fm      Eb    Bb/D
            Yeah,          Yeah,


-Instrument break-   Gm7   A/D   F   C/F   F   Bb   F/A   G   Bb   C   A/C#
                                                                       Ooo Yeah


-Repeat Chorus-


Outro: Fm        C#                 Fm/C    C#/A#
                In exchange for the sweetest addiction,
                C                       Fm
                You:  my elusive drug.
