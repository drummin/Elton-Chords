Intro: |  G7  |  C7  |  G7  |  C7  |


G                      C
The sister of sunlight - comes to my lonely life.
G                   C
Bearing the crosses I hung - I hung on my lonely wife.
Bm                     Em
And the anchor told me if I prayed by the river -
Am7                           Am7/D
that the sweet sound of water   -   would always go with her.



CHORUS:
     G         D/F#           Em
All across the havens, to the waterfall -
     Fmaj7                                       Am
they told me I would meet her there inside those icy walls.
    F                                         C             D
But how on earth in this universe can they forgive me of my pains.
G                  A       C                           Am7    Am7/D   {Intro}
For all across the havens  -  I must stumble locked in chains.



G                         C
Then the mother of mercy  -  showed me her stable.
G                          C
told me you would be safe  -  safe in her cradle.
Bm                       Em
And the waterfall opened and the water withdrew -
Am7                      Am7/D
     leaving me standing   -   on a road leading through.


{Repeat Chorus}
