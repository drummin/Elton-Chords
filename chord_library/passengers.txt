Am        Em	   F
To make a chain of fools

	   G
You need a matching pair

Am	Em	 F
One hypocritical fool

		   G
And a crowd that's never there

	Am    Em     F
There's anger in the silence

			C\G
There's wheels upon the jail

  Am	      Em       F
A black train built of bones

            G
On a copper rail

(CHORUS)

Am   Em    F
Company conductor

	     G
You need the salt of tears

Am      Em   F
Falling on a ticket

	      G
That no one's used in years

Am     Em      F
Non-commercial native

		      C\G
It's tattooed in your veins

       Am     Em   F
You're living in a blood bank

		   G
And riding on this train

(CHORUS)

    Em			   Am
The spirit's free, but you always find

G		     Am
Passengers stand and wait in line

Em			     Am
Someone in front and someone else behind

    Dm7		      G
But passengers always wait in line
 
(CHORUS)
(REPEAT, FADE)
