One Horse Town
by: Elton John and Bernie Taupin


Bass in F#: F# - G#m - A - G#m - Bm - A - G#m - F#

B
Saw a Cadillac for the first time yesterday
Bm				          E
I'd always seen horses, buggies, bales of hay
Am							    D
`Cause progress here don't move with modern times
F#		
There's nothing to steal
		F                   E      D   C  -  *   			
So there's not a great deal of crime - oh! oh!

C
It sure is hell living in a one horse town
Bm					E
There's half a mile of Alabama mud bed ground
Am				  D
Nothing much doing of an afternoon
F#				          F                     E   D  C  -  *
Unless you're sitting in a rocking chair just picking a tune

G#									  C#m
And they ain't too well acquainted with the stars and stripes
		Bb							  C#
But if you want to hear Susanna then they'll pick all night
	    C
They'll pick all night

B				
`Cause it's no dice living in a one horse town
Bm			E
Laid back, as my old coon hound
Am								    D
And I just can't wait to get out of this one horse town
F#				                  F			    E  D  C - *
There's nothing to steal `cause there's simply nothing much around

B						
Sure is hell living in this one horse town
Bm				        E
There's half a mile of Alabama mud bed ground
     Am							    D
And I just can't wait to get out of this one horse town
F#				                 F		   E  D  C - *
There's nothing to steal `cause there's nothing much around
