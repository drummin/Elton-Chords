Bbm	       Gb
Oh, I'm a dark diamond
Ab		     Db  Fm\C
I've turned hard and cold
Bbm		      Ebm7	 Ab  (OCTAVES: Ab Ab Bb  Db Eb)
Once was a jewel with fire in my soul
	Bbm	       Gb
There's two sides of a mirror
Ab		     Db     Fm\C
One I couldn't break through
       Bbm	      	      Ebm7            Fm
Stayed trapped on the inside, wound up losing you

	Db
Tell me how does it work
    Db	   Db\F	       Gb
How do you make things fit
      Fm		    Bbm
Spent all my life trying to get it right
     Ebm7		    Ab
I've put it together and it falls apart
  Db		    Db      Db\F Gb
I thought to myself I might understand
	     Fm
But when the wall's built
	Bbm	      Ebm7
And the heart hardens
Ab	       (Db     Bbm  Ebm7  Ab)*
You get a dark diamond
     (Bbm   Gb  Ebm7  Ab)*
Dark diamond

Oh, I'm a dark diamond
But you're something else
You read me more than I read myself
The one star I could count on
Only comet I could trust
You burnt through my life to the true meaning of love

(CHORUS)

Bbm  Gb  Ab  Db  Fm\C

Bbm  Ebm7  Fm

(CHORUS)

Ab	       (Db     Bbm  Ebm7  Ab)*
You get a dark diamond
     (Bbm   Gb  Ebm7  Ab)*
Dark diamond
(REPEAT, FADE)
