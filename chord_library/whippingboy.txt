Db            Ab
You're cruel, you do
Gb                Db
You do, you do me wrong
Db           Ab
You hurt me, you flirt with
Gb                       Db
Any old face that comes along

Bbm         Gb               Db
But I won't be your whipping boy
   Bbm     Gb               Db
No I won't be your whipping boy
Gbm
Break me like a little toy
Ab
Run me till my feet are sore
      Gb                     Db    Ebm  Gb  Db  Ebm  Gb  Db
But I won't be your whipping boy


You're wild, you're sly
What you done to me
I was thirty, I look like fifty
But I feel like sixty three


Db          Bbm
It's this illegal kind of loving
     Fm/Ab
That keeps my motor running
         Gb
From the start to the finish line
       Bbm                          Eb7
It's a trashy kind of me that likes to believe
Ab
That I'm still trying, I'm still trying

I'm still trying, yes I'm trying


You're dirty, but you're worth it
But you're way, you're way too young
I could do time if they found out
Look out, San Quentin here I come
