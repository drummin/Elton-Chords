     A
What happened here

		       E
As the New York sunset disappeared

		 B			     C#m
I found an empty garden among the flagstones there

    A
Who lived here

				  E
He must have been a gardener that cared a lot

				    B
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop

		     C#m
And now it all looks strange

		   A	      B		     E     (E)*
It's funny how one insect can damage so much grain


    E
And what's it for

				E
This little empty garden by the brownstone door

			    B			      C#m
And in the cracks along the sidewalk nothing grows no more

    A
Who lived here

				  E
He must have been a gardener that cared a lot

				    B
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop

	       C#m			      A
And we are so amazed we're crippled and we're dazed

		B		      E
A gardener like that one no one can replace


	      A			  E
And I've been knocking but no one answers

	      A			    C#m  C#m+3  C#m
And I've been knocking most all the da____________y

		 F#m		    C#m
Oh and I've been calling oh hey hey Johnny

	       A  B    E    (E)**
Can't you come out_ to play


    A
And through their tears

			       E
Some say he farmed his best in younger years

				   B			     C#m
But he'd have said that roots grow stronger if only he could hear

    A
Who lived there

				  E
He must have been a gardener that cared a lot

				    B
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop

		C#m			       A
Now we pray for rain, and with every drop that falls

   B		      E
We hear, we hear your name

(CHORUS)

	      A			  E
And I've been knocking but no one answers

	      A			    C#m  C#m+3  C#m
And I've been knocking most all the da____________y

		 F#m		    C#m
Oh and I've been calling oh hey hey Johnny

	       A    B                     E    
Can't you come out, can't you come out to play


F#m    A		         B		E
Johnny can't you come out to play in your empty garden
